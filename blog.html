                    <p><i>20th December 2020</i></p>
                    <p>
                        In this post I outline my strategy for active reading, when I really want to understand, absorb,
                        and remember the material. I look for and extract mental models, principles, and tools, and make
                        a concerted effort to internalise them using spaced repetition. In this post I explain each of these
                        pieces, and tie it all together with a worked example.

                        I was approached with a too-good-to-be-true opportunity that turned out to be a pyramid scheme.
                        I didn't think I was the sort of person to fall for that sort of thing, but I almost did. This post
                        briefly explains what happened, why it was effectivem and how to not fall for the same trick.
