                    <h5>Small Giants</h5>
                    <p><i>Bo Burlingham</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This is the fifth of several books I plan to read to understand what a great company looks and feels
                        like. The premise is that some companies choose something else instead of going for
                        growth - that something else is usually a better working culture, community involvement, or just being more philanthropic.
                        The book is about a series of case studies of such companies, and investigates what they chose instead
                        of growth, and how they did it. The author looks for and extracts patterns but I was hesitant
                        about blindingly accepting them. In constast to the Good to Great principles which I feel are more timeless
                        and robust, I don't believe these ones are tried and tested, I think they only happened to work for those companies
                        at that particular point in time. Still, it was a nice book and a good reminder that building a
                        business doesn't always have to be about growing as big as you can as quickly as possible.

                    <h5>Little Bets</h5>
                    <p><i>Peter Sims</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This is the fourth of several books I plan to read to understand what a great company looks and feels
                        like. I read this because the principles in both Good to Great and Great by Choice reflect the
                        idea of trying things out to figure out what works, then going all out once you know what you're doing.
                        This idea gels with me a lot, I'm a huge advocate for not trying to plan everything up front, you can't,
                        you simply don't know what's going to happen and you have to be prepared to explore and adapt. That's the
                        empirical approach and I thought Little Bets would be all about that idea. It was to some extent, although
                        it was more about team culture than I was expecting. There were some good ideas in there about being
                        relentless in information gathering (something I don't do enough of), and building a culture of
                        tinkering and playfulness.

                    <h5>Great by Choice</h5>
                    <p><i>Jim Collins</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This is the third of several books I plan to read to understand what a great company looks and feels
                        like. I read this because I liked his other book, Good to Great. This is similar in that it follows
                        the study of a set of great companies where the researchers figure out what principles those companies have in common.
                        This book in particular targets companies that have thrived in uncertainty.
                        I liked and agreed with the principles in this book, in fact they felt more
                        relevant to me and the company I work for than the Good to Great principles. I like Jim Collins'
                        style of packaging up the ideas into neat little concepts with catchy names.

                    <p><i>Daniel Coyle</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This is the second of several books I plan to read to understand what a great company looks and feels
                        like. This was good, and because it was full of example stories I'm starting to get a sense of what
                        a good team feels like to work in, or how to run one. I felt that the takeaways from the book could have been
                        condensed into a few pages but that's okay because the value is in the stories. I'll read again
                        but it's not high on my priority list.

                    <p><i>Jim Collins</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This is the first of several books I plan to read to understand what a great company looks and feels
                        like. I'll admit I was a bit suspicious of this book to begin with, as with any book that does
                        some analysis and claims to have found the recipe for success (survivorship bias..?). But it
                        grew on me over time and I really liked it by the end. I treated the six main concepts as simply
                        ideas not recipes. The acid test was to see if they made sense in my own life as well and most
                        did. Will read again at some point.

                    <h5>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</h5>
                    <p><i>Robert Persig</i></p>
                    <p>
                        I read this one because it pops up again and again on lists like "100 books to read before you die"
                        or "5 books recommended by X", so I thought I'd give it a go. It's possibly one of my favourite
                        books now. It's a true story, woven throughout with bits on philosophy, spirituality, and values.
                        I liked the way it was written, I read it slowly, and I felt like it changed the way I think. I
                        love books that do that. Definitely going to read again.

                    <p><i>Patterson, Grenny, McMillan, Switzler</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Both my friend and I read this because we needed to have a tough conversation about the future
                        of a project we wanted to do together. This book reads like a business training course (which
                        it is), and I'm not usually a fan of such books, but I did find this one useful. There were
                        several principles, mental models, and tools for me to take away and learn.

                    <p><i>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Read because I liked his first one, Fooled by Randomness. (I've actually read this a few times now).
                        The book is about one central idea, that there is a class of events that are rare but have disproportionate
                        impact (positive or negative), and that they are fundamentally unpredictable. Despite the simple message, it's one
                        of those books where every page is packed with insights. What I like the most is that it's slightly mathematical,
                        slightly philosophical, and (to be honest) quite rambling and unstructured, but for that's a positive, it makes
                        it fun to read.

                    <h5>The Places Inbetween</h5>
                    <p><i>Rory Stewart</i></p>
                    <p>
                        An eye-opening description of his walk across Afghanistan. A raw, and honest view of rural
                        Afghan life. It's not a description of a sightseeing or backpacking holiday; no hostels,
                        no airbnb, no shops or cafes. What I found most incredible was how every night he finds a village and the hosts take
                        him in (most of the time), feed him, provide him (some) shelter, and talk and share their lives with him. They
                        provide stories of their ancestory and past, send their sons to guide him over the snowy mountains to the next village 20 miles away,
                        and generally welcome him to their homes (often dry mud huts) all because he's a guest in their valley. Imagine
                        trying that in the UK... For me it was a stark insight into what life was probably like hundreds of years ago. I bet
                        life was a bit more personable and human back then.

                    <h5>Economics in One Lesson</h5>
                    <p><i>Henry Hazlitt</i></p>
                    <p>
                        A good introduction to some fundamental economic principles and mental models in economics,
                        the main one being that whatever policy is implemented, you must consider effects on all parties, not
                        just the most vocal one, and secondary effects over time, not just the immediate ones. This won't make you a
                        master in economics but it will equip you with the mental models that will help you to reason
                        intelligently about many of the political and economic problems we have today.

                    <h5>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</h5>
                    <p><i>Jordan Peterson</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This book is what I thought 21 Lessons would be. Both authors build on
                        the same set of ideas (human cooperation through shared belief systems), Yuval's books lay
                        the groundwork by introducing human history, how those belief systems have evolved in the 75,000
                        years humans have been around, and does a great job of explaining why we are where we are today. It
                        also expands your horizons as to what the next few decades might be like. On the other hand, 12 Rules for Life
                        offers a very practical set of guidelines on what to actually do about it. I found it much more accessible after
                        reading Yuval Harari, in that framework this book would fit into the libertarian take on the meaning of life
                        (the one I most identify with). Biggest takeaway? Humans need order, rules, and values, but too much
                        order isn't a good thing either. The path to the good life is the one that treads a fine line between the two.

                    <h5>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</h5>
                    <p><i>Yuval Noah Harari</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Before you read this, read Sapiens first, followed by Homo Deus, by the same author.
                        If Sapiens is past, and Homo Deus is future, this book considers the present and why we need to think
                        seriously about where humanity is heading. I learned a lot about why humanity is the way it is today.
                        I also found it shocking, and the whole book has shaken up my view of the world, but
                        that's probably a good thing. Biggest takeaway? A real sense of urgency. It's now more important
                        than ever for me (everyone) to figure out who we are, and who we want to be in the 21st Century.

                    <p><i>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This was a re-read from a long time ago, but I hadn't started keeping track of books then.
                        It's about randomness in every day life, and why we understand and appreciate it less than we should. The
                        book is essentially a guide to being fooled by randomness as little as possible. It's one of those books
                        where every page is packed with insights, and although the content is a bit all over the place (the author self
                        describes the book as a collection of essays), I found I liked the style. Biggest takeaway was to always
                        try and be aware of the histories that didn't take place, which is harder than you think.

                    <h5>Creative Blindness</h5>
                    <p><i>Dave Trott</i></p>
                    <p>
                        I read this because I like Dave's other books, One + One = Three and Predatory Thinking.
                        All Dave's books are collections of anecdotes, each with an important
                        lesson to learn. In this book, those lessons are mostly on creativity. It was enjoyable to read and
                        I recorded a list of ten or so new ideas or principles that I think will be helpful for life in general.
                        I won't share them all here, (honestly, read the book yourself, you'll get more out of it), however the one I liked
                        the most was; creative solutions are <i>usually</i> the combination of two separate and unrelated problems
                        where somebody had the insight to spot the connection. The book is basically a long list of examples of that rule.
