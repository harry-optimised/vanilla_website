                <h1>LLM Agents Series</h1>

                <p>
                    Something I've wanted to do for a long time is explore the use of Large Language Models in the
                    construction of autonomous agents, where you
                    use the LLM as the "brain" and build scaffolding around it to let it interact with the world. In
                    this case that world is minecraft, partly
                    because there are already tools for creating bots for the game, and partly because the Voyager paper
                    deployed LLM agents into minecraft. There's
                    also something really quite satisfying about watching your agent explore a proper 3D world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've only just started in this space, so expect more content to follow soon. The rough guide will be
                    to start with a simple environment that we
                    can use to control the agent, and then we'll build up the complexity of the agent's tasks. Finally
                    we'll look at the Voyager paper itself.
                </p>

                            This will let us get up and running quickly whilst understanding fully what is going on."
