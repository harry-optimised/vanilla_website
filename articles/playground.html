                <p><i>19th March 2024</i></p>
                <p>
                    Github repository tag corresponding to this post is <i><a
                            href="https://github.com/harry-optimised/discovery/tree/part-1">Part 1 - A Basic
                            Loop</a></i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This first post is about getting a simple Sense, Think, Act loop up and running so that we have
                    something to build upon in future posts. For the installation see the repository README.
                </p>
                <h3>Components of the System</h3>
                <p>
                    There are three components. First we have Minecraft itself with several mods installed. This
                    provides the entire simulated world and physics. There are several good reasons for using Minecraft
                    as our simulator. Firstly, it’s a full blown 3D, procedural, survival game that contains NPCs,
                    items, weather, time, and a variety of terrains. Agents in Minecraft can explore, build, attack,
                    talk, dig, craft, etc and much more. This gives us a <i>vast</i> set of possibilities for giving our
                    agents goals and behaviour, and we can see our results in realtime in a high fidelity 3D
                    environment. Secondly there are existing tools for building Minecraft bots that make it easy to move
                    about and interact with the world, saving us from having to deal with low level details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the low level control of the bot, such a moving around the world, we use the <a
                        href="https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer">Mineflayer toolkit</a>. As far I can tell,
                    Mineflayer is the best tool for building Minecraft bots, it has a lot of functionality and
                    it's well maintained. It's also written in JavaScript. Unfortunately, I want to write my LLM agent
                    logic in Python (more on which shortly) therefore I need to split the agent into two parts, a
                    JavaScript based component handles interaction with Minecraft, and a Python component that handles
                    interaction with the LLM. A natural way to have the two components talk to each other is over HTTP,
                    therefore we have a simple Node.js server called the <i>Agent</i> that provides a simple API for
                    both sensing the environment, and performing actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we have the controller, written in Python, and calling out to an LLM using langchain. The
                    controller implements the Sense, Think, Act loop, where the Sense, and Act steps are calls to the
                    Node.js server with some predefined actions. I chose to write this in Python because it's my
                    preferred language for implementing complex applications. The diagram below describes the high level
                    intent for the architecture.
                </p>
