                <h1>Standard Python Project Setup</h1>
                <p><i>Updated 3rd January 2022</i></p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    I've worked with Python for the last five years, and in that time I've converged to a
                    common structure for Python projects that works for most use cases. This structure has been informed
                    by articles I've read, the people I've worked with, and experience in the field. It is intended
                    to capture best practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current setup is heavily influenced by the way I currently do things at work, and as
                    should be expected, it's always evolving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this reference article, I cover the following topics.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Repository Structure</p></li>
                    <li><p>Development Style</p></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Repository Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    See this public repository for an example.
                    <a href="https://github.com/HarryTurner93/python_project">Template Python Project</a>
                </p>
                <h5>Github Actions</h5>
                <p>
                    I default to Github Actions for Continuous Integration as it keeps it together with my
                    version control tools. All projects should have an <code>on-push.yml</code>
                    action that runs the linter, type checks, and unit tests upon each push to the repository.
                </p>
                <h5>Source Folder</h5>
                <p>
                    I keep all source code inside a <code>src</code> folder. Most projects also benefit from being made
                    into a package, so I usually create a Python package inside <code>src</code> and put all the code in there.
                </p>
                <h5>.gitignore</h5>
                <p>
                    I use <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore">this</a>
                    comprehensive <code>.gitignore</code> file. I uncomment the <code>.idea/</code> directive at the bottom
                    as I use PyCharm for my IDE.
                </p>
                <h5>Easy Scripts</h5>
                <p>
                    Every project includes a 'scripts' folder of bash scripts for starting, stopping, linting, and
                    unit testing the codebase. These scripts are named <code>start.sh</code>, <code>stop.sh</code>,
                    <code>lint.sh</code>, and <code>unit.sh</code> respectively. I do this because different projects
                    may have different ways of testing or starting the app. For instance, Django has
                    <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/testing/overview/">its own way</a> to run
                    unit tests. For a given repository, I put the appropriate commands inside the relevant bash script,
                    this acts as both a reference and as a convenience script for quickly running common tasks.
                </p>
                <h5>Local Environment - Poetry</h5>
                <p>
                    In a later section I will discuss my typical development style in detail, for now I'll
                    just say that I prefer to develop by writing tests. However, I dislike having to launch my app within
                    a local development environment in order to unit test it. Usually I will
                    create a local Python environment with Poetry and install the packages into it with
                    <code>poetry install</code>. Now I can run my unit tests with <code>poetry run pytest</code>, or
                    do any formatting & linting, and run typechecking using equivalent commands.
                </p>
                <h5>Local Environment - Nox</h5>
                <p>
                    Although I can run tests with <code>poetry run pytest</code>, I usually put tests, linting,
                    formatting, and type checking into a noxfile and use the <a href="https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/">Nox</a>
                    test runner to run tests for me. It makes it convenient to run all the checks in one command which
                    makes the CI easy too. When using Nox I run tests with <code>poetry run nox -s test</code>.
                </p>
                <h5>Local Environment - Docker & Docker Compose</h5>
                <p>
                    Not all apps can be developed in this way however, some benefit from being launched into a dedicated
                    environment, a notable example is Django. For this, I will use a
                    <code>Dockerfile</code> and a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file that sets up any extra services
                    needed to run the app, like a database for example. Running <code>docker-compose</code> is
                    <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/">trivial</a>
                    but I still usually put the commands into the <code>start.sh</code> script in case any
                    other non-standard setup is required.
                </p>
                <h5>Production Environment - Docker</h5>
                <p>
                    I run production apps within a
                    <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">Docker container</a>, as it's the
                    easiest way to deploy into my most common deployment environments, Kubernetes for instance.
                    The <code>Dockerfile</code> describes how my app should run. I use the same <code>Dockerfile</code>
                    for both running locally with <code>docker-compose</code> and in production.
                </p>
                <h5>Tests</h5>
                <p>
                    I'll talk more about tests in a later section when I go into detail on my development process,
                    for now I'll say that I lean heavily on unit tests and will use Pytest wherever I can. I use
                    the <a href="">pytest-cov</a> extension to measure code coverage. The commands
                    to run the tests are in the <code>unit.sh</code> script, which also takes care of setting
                    any environment variables needed to configure the app for testing.
                </p>
                <h5>README and Documentation</h5>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about comprehensive, useful, and relevant documentation. I am also well aware of
                    how difficult it is to keep it up to date, despite the best efforts to maintain it. I'll
                    describe my structure for documentation, and provide a couple of tricks I use for staying on top of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, the <code>README.md</code> should provide a short introduction to the project, requirements
                    for running the app, and detailed steps on how to install it and run it. Where relevant, I include
                    badges for various CI metrics such passing builds, code quality, and version information. I put
                    detailed design documentation in a separate markdown file and link to it from the README.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The structure of the detailed design documentation loosely follows
                    <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1016-2009.html">IEEE 1016-2009</a>. I will include
                    relevant UML diagrams to explain a process or architecture more clearly. I'll explain and justify
                    any major or unusual design decisions. I'll also tend to put requirements in here as well unless
                    they're being managed as part of an external process. See a typical example
                    <a href="https://github.com/HarryTurner93/thea">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To keep documentation up to date, I have a rule where if I am asked something about
                    the system such as how it works, or whether it does thing X, or has feature Y - As well as
                    providing an answer, I add the information (or directions on how to find the answer) to the
                    documentation. I also include a dedicated documentation step in my development process on which
                    I'll go into more detail later.
                </p>
                <h5>Projen</h5>
                <p>
                    Most of what I am mentioning here is fairly general and applicable to most of my Python projects,
                    therefore it helps immensely if I can create a project template that uses these defaults. To do this,
                    I use <a href="https://github.com/projen/projen">Projen</a>, a tool for defining and maintaining
                    complex project configuration through code. The advantage over other templating tools is that it
                    allows you to update and modify generate files (it's not a one off generator). I use a custom
                    projen layout which is defined in my sample repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, that sample repository IS the projen template. To use it I submodule the template repository
                    into my project repository, run the bash script to link it, and then run <code>npx projen</code> to
                    generate the project files.
                </p>
                <h3>Development</h3>
                <h5>Code Hygiene with FILTURED</h5>
                <p>
                    When I am working on a new feature, before I declare it complete I will use the following checklist
                    to give me confidence that the code is correct and of high quality. Note that this isn't the same
                    as feature completion from the perspective of the product owner who may have their own user
                    acceptance tests and other criterion.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>F</b>ormat. I run <code>python3.9 -m black src/</code> to format all code to a consistent
                            style. <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">black</a> is a commonly used and
                            opinionated code formatter. I highly recommend it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>I</b>mport Order. I separate imports into three groups. System Imports are those
                            packages that ship with Python, Third Party Imports are those that need to be installed
                            and are part of the <code>requirements.txt</code> file. Finally Relative Imports are those
                            from elsewhere in the codebase.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>L</b>int. I run <code>python3.9 -m flake8 src/</code> to run the flake8 code linter on all
                            my source files. I tend to install <code>flake8-annotations</code> and
                            <code>flake8-docstrings</code> as well. The first enforces proper use of type annotations,
                            the second helps me write better docstrings.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>T</b>yping. I run <code>python3.9 -m mypy src/</code> to run the static type checker on
                            all my source files. Since I used <code>flake8-annotations</code>, the code should be heavily
                            typed, allowing mypy to catch bugs. I put the commands for both the linting and type
                            checking steps into <code>lint.sh</code>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>U</b>nit Tests. I make sure all code is unit tested with high coverage. Tests should be
                            runnable with the command <code>bash unit.sh</code>. I also make sure that any new tests are
                            run as part of the CI on-push step.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>R</b>egression Tests. This one can't been done within the local codebase, it's a
                            reminder. If relevant, I write and run tests against the deployed
                            system (which includes interaction with other services I have running).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>E</b>asy Scripts. This is a reminder to make sure all my easy scripts are up-to-date
                            and working.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>D</b>ocumentation. Finally, I document everything. I strive to keep documentation updated
                            as I go, so this step usually involves finding the relevant place in the documentation
                            and editing/adding to that section. I also check the quality of my comments as part of this step.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Note that my standard noxfile.py will include sections for black formatting, linting, typing, and tests,
                    which means that by simply running <code>poetry run nox</code> I can hit the first FILTU of the above checklist.
                </p>
                <h5>Comments</h5>
                <p>
                    I make liberal use of comments <i>where they clearly add value</i>. Otherwise, I prefer
                    the code be self-explanatory which is an incentive to make it as simple and readable as possible.
                    Comments add value when they provide justification for <i>why</i> something was done. Bad comments
                    will just repeat what the code is already communicating. I will often link to an article or stack
                    overflow page where a piece of code or idea came from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have suggested two places to put design decision documentation, within the comments, and within
                    the documentation. I find value in both. Comments have the advantage of being local to the code,
                    they're available right when they're needed which is more helpful for the reader. They're also more
                    likely to be kept up to date. Design documentation is useful for higher level decisions and rationale
                    and is often structured in a way that is easier to navigate for those not familiar with the codebase.
                </p>
                <h5>Test Driven Development (ish)</h5>
                <p>
                    I write code by writing the test for it <i>at the same time</i>. This isn't
                    strictly <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/">Test Driven Development</a>, although
                    it is close. (It's probably more test augmented development).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I program, I force myself not to run my app directly to see changes, rather I will run it via a test
                    and assert the output is as expected. I also make heavy use of mocks to assert that my functions
                    are making the correct function calls, with the correct arguments. I find it helpful to use
                    pytest's <code>-s</code> option to direct standard output to the console.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will write tests for one function at a time and will mock every function call that
                    function-under-test makes. To assert correct behaviour, I typically create a class
                    for the mocked function with a <code>def __call__()</code> function that captures that
                    call and any arguments passed to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of my projects use <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">boto3</a>
                    to interact with AWS services. My favourite way to test AWS calls is to use <a href="https://github.com/spulec/moto">moto</a>
                    which provides decorators to mock AWS requests. I have moved away from testing using
                    <a href="https://localstack.cloud/">LocalStack</a>, as it requires me to launch both LocalStack
                    and the app locally with <code>docker-compose</code>. As I said earlier, I prefer to
                    run everything directly on the codebase with unit tests. That being said, LocalStack has its place
                    if I want to run more comprehensive tests against multiple services at once. At this point however
                    I'm starting to write system tests and would argue that it's more valuable to write a system test
                    against the actual production system instead, rather than a simulated local version of it.
                </p>
                <h5>Branching</h5>
                <p>
                    I follow a pretty standard branching model. I have a master branch, a staging branch, and then feature
                    branches. I will create new features in their own branch and I use the semantic commit messages
                    defined <a href="https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716">here</a>. I'll
                    make PR's into the staging branch (which may have an associated staging environment) and then I'll
                    make a PR from the staging environment into master which triggers system tests to run against staging.
                    This way, by the time code has entered master, a full system test has run against a representative
                    deployment environment.
                </p>
                <h3>Configuration</h3>
                <p>
                    An example of my typical configuration strategy can be found in the
                    <a href="https://github.com/HarryTurner93/python_project">example project</a>. My approach is to
                    make a <code>CONFIG</code> object available globally by exporting it from <code>config.config</code>.
                    The <code>base_config.py</code> defines this config object and specifies what configuration
                    options are available. Then for each environment I override the base object with the specific
                    values needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The local environment specifies configuration values for running within <code>docker-compose</code>
                    which usually means setting URL endpoints to LocalStack instead of AWS proper. I have a local
                    testing environment which is the configuration loaded by the unit tests. These typically stub
                    out most of the configuration options. Finally, the production configuration grabs the values
                    from environment variables so that they can be passed in and dynamically changed more easily.
