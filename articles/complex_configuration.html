        <h3 id="context">Context</h3>
        <p>
          At Ultraleap, I&#39;m part of a team building an internal research
          platform for our engineers and data scientists. The platform&#39;s
          main capabilities are storing and accessing large amounts of data, and
          allowing users to execute custom code on AWS remote machines.
        </p>
        <h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          There&#39;s one particular task that users run regularly on the
          platform and it requires a huge amount of configuration to be
          specified. I&#39;m talking hundreds of options organised
          hierarchically. Even though it has defaults, understanding and
          navigating the set of options is a challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          This complex configuration is currently provided in one big YAML file,
          and whilst there are benefits to YAML (it can be version controlled,
          it&#39;s human readable), it is also easy to make mistakes. The
          feedback cycle from validating the YAML only after the task had
          started was frustrating our users.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a general problem here. How to make it easy and less error
          prone for users to edit large, complex configuration files.
        </p>

        <h3 id="solution">Parts of a Solution</h3>
        <p><strong>YAML In - YAML Out</strong></p>
        <p>
          Firstly, it's important to ensure the user doesn't lose any existing
          capabilities. They already work with YAML files so we should support
          import and export so that we seamlessly integrate with their existing
          tools.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Fully Featured YAML Editor</strong></p>
        <p>
          Presumably the user already has a preferred text editor for working
          with YAML. I'm not proposing we replace it (see above). However, we'll
          see shortly that providing our own fully featured YAML editor has
          advantages. It should have enough features to not feel like a
          downgrade from their current editor. There are plenty of off-the-shelf
          components for this,
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ace">React ACE Editor</a>
          for example.
        </p>
        <p><strong>UI Forms</strong></p>
        <p>
          A set of configuration represented in YAML can also be represented as
          a form with text fields, check boxes, switches, drop down select
          menus, and more. This can be a more natural way to interact with the
          configuration (although not always). There are off-the-shelf
          components for building such forms from a configuration schema.
          <a href="https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form"
            >React JSONSchema Forms</a
          >
          for example.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Multiple Synchronised Representations</strong></p>
        <p>
          This is a fancy way of saying that the form and the editor should be
          displayed side by side and kept in sync. If an option is changed in
          the form, it should update in the editor and vice versa. You can take
          any underlying state and represent it in multiple ways at the same
          time, it's a powerful way to provide the user the benefits of both.
          This pattern is used a lot, <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a> for
          example for displaying encoded and decoded JWTs.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Instant Validation</strong></p>
        <p>
          The best kind of feedback is instantaneous feedback. If I make a
          mistake I want to know whilst I'm still thinking about it. There's no
          reason a tool can't do the heavy lifting in the background, constantly
          validating that the configuration will work.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Inject Context</strong></p>
        <p>
          We can take the above idea further. As well as telling the user when
          something is wrong, we can also give them information when it's right.
          For example, given the current configuration perhaps we could compute
          the estimated time the task will take. If we then display that
          information right there inside the config, the user can iterate on it
          in real time!
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="../images/articles/complex_configuration/inject_context.png"
          />
          <p>
            <i
              >Example of contextual feedback taken straight form our
              platform.</i
            >
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Predictive Editing</strong></p>
        <p>
          If I'm editing a YAML file in VSCode with Github Copilot enabled, then
          it will attempt to predict what I'm going to type next. For configs
          like Kubernetes manifests it usually does a pretty good job. We could
          do the same thing easily with an LLM, or even with a few simple rules.
        </p>
        <h3 id="solution">Wrap Up</h3>
        <p>
          We built a front-end app that displayed a dynamically generated form
          next to the YAML editor. The form was generated from a JSON schema
          that was derived from the task's configuration, and the form and
          editor were kept in sync. We validated the configuration in real time
          and provided contextual feedback as described above, but we could not
          justify predictive editing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result was quick and easy to build, requiring only a bit of glue
          code to stitch the off-the-shelf components together. It allowed our
          users to rapidly build validated configuration files with fewer
          mistakes.
