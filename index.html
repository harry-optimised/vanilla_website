        <h3>Hey, I'm Harry.</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a backend engineer with over five years experience building
          data-intensive applications in venture-backed startups. I've taken ML
          based products from concept to production. I've also built several
          frontend user interfaces. On this site you can find a collection of my
          more interesting projects. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if
          you want to chat.
