                    I'm the tech lead for the Data Platform team at <a href="https://vaarst.com/">
                    Vaarst</a>.
                    We're building a data platform in AWS to allow our customers to intelligently
                    access, manage, and analyse geo-referenced offshore data.

                    This isn't a website about that, however.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I work on personal projects in my spare time and read
                    things that interest me, mostly around Machine Learning and System Design. My passion is designing
                    and building systems with AI and ML at their core, and it's what I'm focussing my career around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This blog is a place to capture thoughts and ideas relating to that goal, somewhere to keep track
                    of progress, to reflect and write things down that I've learned along the way. Although I'm
                    doing it for me, I'm making it public in case anything here is of use to somebody else.

                        As an indy developer interested in using natural language processing capabilities in my own projects, I wanted to see how easy it would be to use the OpenAI API and some local unstructured textual data to build something useful.

                        I'm spending it effectively. Results suggest that no, I'm not using it
                        effectively at all. I introduce a tool I built to help me do better.
