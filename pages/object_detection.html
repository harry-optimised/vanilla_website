        <h1>Object Detection with Deep Learning Series</h1>

        <p>
          This series dives deep into the technical detail behind the early
          objection detection architectures using Deep Learning. I cover the
          canonical two-stage object detectors and cover the transition to
          single-stage detectors which paved the way for the current modern
          architectures like YOLOv8 and more.

                                    detection problem can be framed as region proposal and classification. R-CNN (Regions with CNN Features)
                                    was the first architecture to use deep learning for some of the system components.
                                    This article examines the architecture in detail, and highlights the various tricks that made it effective."

              description="This article explores the SPP-Net model, the architecture that introduced the spatial pyramid pooling layer.
                                    This is a nice model to study because it tackles one of the key problems with R-CNN, which is that it is slow.
                                    It also paves the way towards Fast R-CNN."

              description="Fast R-CNN addressed the slowness of R-CNN by moving everything into one network.
                                    They use a variation of the spatial pyramid pooling layer (although they call it ROI pooling) to allow the network to sample features at different scales. Finally
                                    we discuss how bounding boxes are parameterised within a network, as it's a good example of how to design
                                    your network to match the problem."

              description="Faster R-CNN innovated in the network architecture. They recognised that region proposal was
                                    also object detection, so they put an object detector in an object detector. This article spends
                                    some time exploring how to think of the architecture as building blocks, which is a useful way
                                    to think about object detectors in general. I also introduce anchors as a way of parameterising
                                    a set of initial bounding boxes."

                                    Faster R-CNN that adds a mask branch to the network. This is a good example of how to add additional
                                    branches to a network to give it more capabilities. It also shows how to use the same feature maps for
                                    multiple tasks. I'll spend most of the article discussing the ROI Align layer which is essential for

                                    incarnation of YOLO and SSD, it uses bipartite matching to assign ground truth boxes to anchor boxes."

                                    actually quite simple once you know how it works. I'll spend a lot of time on the loss function in this article."
