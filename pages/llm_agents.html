        <h1>LLM Agents Series</h1>

        <p>
          This series documents my journey in learning to build embodied LLM
          agents in Minecraft. This is not a how-to article. I don't know how
          best to build these agents. But I hope to figure it out by building
          lots of them and seeing what works. If you follow along you'll see me
          make many mistakes and go down plenty of rabbit holes, but hopefully
          we'll see a picture begin to emerge. My goal is to work towards a
          foundational understanding of the state of the art, notably the
          Voyager paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why Minecraft? Because it's what the Voyager paper uses, and there are
          already good tools for building bots for Minecraft, I do not intend to
          reinvent the wheel. There's also something deeply satisfying about
          watching your agents explore a proper 3D world.
        </p>

              description="This first post is about getting <i>something</i> up and running, a simple Sense, Think, Act loop so that we have something to build upon in future posts. Includes setting up Minecraft, the Node.js agent for sensing and interacting with the world, and a basic LLM powered controller. We end up with a bot that can run around the world and talk to us."
