        <h1>Uncertainty Sampling Techniques</h1>
        <p><i>24th April 2021</i></p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In this short post I cover several Uncertainty Sampling techniques
          that I use in practice for computing an uncertainty score on a
          probability distribution over classes. I use this score to rank images
          by their uncertainty to help me choose which ones to label as part of
          an active learning strategy.
        </p>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          In this section I briefly introduce a few different ways of doing
          uncertainty sampling on the predicted class distribtion. A class
          distribution is just an array of numbers that add up to one, therefore
          these exact same techniques will work for image classification tasks
          and object detection tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these are phrased as confidence scores because it's easier to
          think about, confidence scores are between 0 and 1 so to turn them
          into uncertainty scores you simply subtract them from 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Least Confidence.</b> One of the simplest. It's the difference
          between the most confident prediction and 100%. It only looks at the
          most confident prediction and ignores everything else. To turn it into
          an uncertainty score we need to normalise according to the code below.

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <b>Margin of Confidence.</b> Take the difference between the top two
          predicted classes. If our model is uncertain then it's likely getting
          confused between two classes, so the gap between the two most
          confident clases will be low. If it's certain then that gap would be
          large. To normalise we simply subtract from 1 as in the code sample
          below.

        <p>
          <b>Entropy.</b> Entropy is an uncertainty measure rather than a
          confidence measure like the two above. It is maximised when all the
          inputs are the same value, i.e when the model is maximally confused.
          It is minimised when one class is 100% and all the others are 0, i.e.
          when the model is completely certain.

        </div>
        <p>
          <b>Mutual Information.</b> An uncertainty measure that uses an
          ensemble of models. First compute the average probability for a
          particular box over an ensemble of models (requires them all to
          predict the same box). The mutual information is the entropy of the
          average probability minus the average of the individual entropes.
          Mutual Information scores more highly samples with high disagreement
          between the ensemble models.
