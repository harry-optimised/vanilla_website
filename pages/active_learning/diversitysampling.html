        <h1>Diversity Sampling Techniques</h1>
        <p><i>24th April 2021</i></p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In this short post I cover several Diversity Sampling techniques that
          I use in practice for finding diverse images to label as part of an
          active learning strategy.
        </p>

        <h3>Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          Our goal here is to select N images from the list in such a way that
          we maximise diversity whilst preserving the most uncertain images.
          Here are a few ways to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Filtering.</b> We immediately discard the bottom X% of the images
          and the do some sort of diversity sampling from the remaining images.
          As a concrete example, image we have a pool of 1000 images but we only
          want to label 50. We first discard 80% of the images to leave us with
          the 200 most uncertain. Now, no matter what diversity sampling method
          we use, we know that we'll still be selecting the most uncertain
          images. There are plenty of differen diversity sampling methods we
          could then use, I'll discuss a common one here which is to use a
          clustering method, like K-Means. We run K-Means with K=50, that will
          attempt to cluster the remaining 200 images into 50 clusters that
          roughly capture the distribution of the space. Then we simply take the
          50 centroids from each cluster and use those as our final set of
          images to label.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>K Means ++.</b> This is a diversity sampling technique that uses
          the uncertainty score within it. Therefore you don't need to think
          about how you're going to combine the two, it does it for you. First
          we randomly select an image from the pool X and add it to a set C
          which is our set of centroids. For each image in X we compute the
          distance to the <i>nearest</i> centroid and store that information.
          Now we select an image from X and add it to C by randomly choosing it
          according to the probability distribution proportional to it's
          distance and uncertainty score. The intuition is that the image that
          has the maximum distance from a centroid <i>and</i> the highest
          uncertainty is the one most likely to be sampled to be the next
          centroid. We repeat until we've got N centroids and then simply use
          that as the selected set for labelling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both of these strategies make use of computing distances between
          images, and it's worth pointing out that the way we would do this for
          images is to extract an image embedding using a deep encoder and then
          doing something like euclidean or cosine distance in embedding space.
          This is beyond what I wanted to talk about in this article but
          fundamentally there's almost always some sensible notion of distance
          you can use for these techniques regardless of the modality of your
          data.
