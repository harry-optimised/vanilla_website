        <h1>Build Something You Can't Live Without</h1>
        <p><i>3rd December 2022</i></p>

        <p>
          How do you build things that users will love and pay for? It's a
          question I've been pondering, and I recently rediscovered the
          following idea. If you build something to solve one of your own
          problems, in such a way that you couldn't live without that product,
          is that a good indication that other people will like it too?
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the space of all possible problems, almost all of them are
          problems that people won't care about. This is the domain of
          well-designed products that never make it to market, apps with no
          downloads, and unread blog posts. But there exists a small subset of
          problems that people do care about. If you're going to build a useful
          product, then it needs to lie in this subset.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="../../images/miscellaneous/buildsomething/space_of_problems.png"
          />
          <p><i>The space of problems.</i></p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Just because you're in the subset of problems that people care about,
          it doesn't guarantee that <i>everyone</i> will care about it. If
          you're unlucky, it might just be you that has that problem. But in my
          experience, if it's a problem that at least one person cares about,
          there's a good chance that others will care about it too. Most people
          have similar problems, we're not as unique as we think we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand your own problem better than you could ever understand
          someone else's problem. Other people must communicate their problem to
          you (see
          <a href="https://alexw.substack.com/p/information-compression"
            >Information Compression </a
          >), and you have to be skilled at eliciting the essence of those
          problems if you're going to solve them. But when you solve your own
          problems, you are your own user, you are constantly getting cheap and
          honest user feedback. This means that the chance of you getting the
          product right is much higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if you don't have a problem? The main limitation of this
          technique is that we are limited to solving problems that lie within
          our scope of experience. I'm okay with not living on Mars, so does
          that prevent me from building SpaceX? One way around this is to go out
          and experience more problems, if you want to build a product to solve
          a problem, spend some time becoming a user who experiences that
          problem first hand.
        </p>

          This isn't new advice, it crops up regularly in different contexts.
          For example,
          <a
            href="http://paulgraham.com/own.html?utm_medium=email&utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_term=fav"
            >A Project of One's Own</a
          >
          by Paul Graham, or even investment advice
          <a href="https://home.csulb.edu/~pammerma/fin382/screener/lynch.htm"
            >Peter Lynch - Invest in What You Know.</a
          >
          Despite the prevalence of the idea, it doesn't seem to be popular with
          people I speak with. I see companies launching products, or founders
          starting companies in markets in which they have no personal
          experience. If you're going to do this you better be sure you've
          nailed your understanding of the customer problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally I don't have time for that, I'd rather spend my time and
          effort building and creating stuff I love. If I choose to solve a
          problem that bugs the hell out of me, then there's at least one user
          that won't be able to live without my product.
