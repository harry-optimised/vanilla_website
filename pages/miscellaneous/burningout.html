        <h1>On Not Burning Out</h1>
        <p><i>20th January 2021</i></p>
        <p>
          This is a short story of my personal experience. It is a reminder to
          myself that balance in life is important.
        </p>
        <p>
          I deliberately called this post On <i><b>Not</b></i> Burning Out,
          because I don't believe I have ever fully burned out. But I have come
          close several times, and recently it happened again. Despite the
          experience being a stressful one, I consider myself lucky, because it
          served as a sharp reminder that I need to keep things in check, and
          it's only now that I have the time to think about and appreciate the
          lesson, that I realise how important it really is. It's so important,
          that I'm writing this post as a reminder, mostly for future me, but
          for others as well. We could all do with such a reminder every now and
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I, like a lot of people, like to be ambitious and sometimes bite off
          more than I can chew. Last year was one of those times, and for the
          nine months from March to December 2020, I slowly committed to more
          and more and increased my involvement in those commitments.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of November, it was beginning to burn me out, and things
          were starting to slip. The funny thing about committing to a lot is
          that when it's all going smoothly, you have the illusion of control,
          but when just one commitment starts to become volatile, you quickly
          realise how
          <a
            href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/05/Too-Efficient"
            >little capacity</a
          >
          you have to absorb that volatility. One of my biggest commitments
          unexpectedly blew up in my face, and because I was so invested, I had
          no choice but to stick it out - at the expense of everything else. Had
          I not packed my time as fully as possible, I would have been fine, but
          instead, my other commitments floundered, my mental health suffered,
          and my energy and enthusiasm took a dive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, the Christmas break forced me to take a natural pause. I
          was surprised by how long it took me to recover, I didn't bounce back
          in the space of a few days, I went through several mental stages of
          recovery before I began feeling like myself again. So far this year, I
          have slowed my pace down just a little, and it has given me time to
          think and reflect on what I'm doing. Now I want to share a few
          benefits I've noticed in myself.

          By slowing down and reflecting on my experience as I go, I've noticed
          that I am better at what I do. I have time to just sit and consider
          what I'm trying to accomplish, I can read more around the topic, and
          think about it more deeply. Because I'm thinking more deeply, I have
          noticed that I have more spontaneous ideas, and those ideas are
          usually more creative and insightful. Ironically, this makes me do
          better and faster work than I would achieve by simply working harder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've become a nicer person. I have more patience for people and more
          compassion. I remember that towards the end of last year, when doing
          something as simple as going to the supermarket, I would get
          internally mad at people for being slow or blocking the aisle. I'd
          rationalise the response by telling myself that I worked really hard
          and therefore didn't deserve to have these idiots stress me out more
          than I already was. Of course, the world doesn't work like that. Now I
          just smile, it doesn't bother me. I've noticed that I'm more in
          control of my emotions when I have time to deal with them properly.
          All my relationships have benefitted as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happier, and I enjoy my work. I've rediscovered that
          craftsman-like passion for making things. I've remembered that the
          purpose of my life is not simply to
          <a href="https://longreads.com/2020/09/08/out-there-on-not-finishing/"
            >produce and achieve as much as I can</a
          >, at some point I should try and enjoy myself along the way,
          otherwise, what am I doing it all for? The funny thing is, when you're
          racing at a hundred miles an hour, you don't have time to remind
          yourself of such things when those are precisely the things you need
          reminding of most.

          I am not a psychologist. I am not a mental health expert. I am not
          qualified to tell you how to live your life. I'm just one person who's
          slowly understanding the value of balance, and I hope I can inspire
          you to do the same.
