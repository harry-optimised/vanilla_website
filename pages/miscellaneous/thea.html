        <h1>Thea - An ML Camera Trap Image Analysis Tool</h1>
        <p><i>8th August 2021</i></p>
        <p>
          A friend of mine is enthusiastic about using camera traps to detect
          wildlife in his garden, and has successfully snapped a few photos of
          deer, cats, badgers, foxes, and the occasional bird. He's also
          unsuccessfully snapped thousands more photos of branches and leaves
          which trigger the camera every time the wind blows. This means that
          after leaving the camera on for just one night, he has to sift through
          thousands of photos by hand to find the ones with the wildlife in. I
          thought this would be a problem ripe for machine learning and set
          about building a system to help him out.
        </p>
        <p>
          What follows is a brief overview of what I built. This first section
          is a quick introduction to the aims of the project, section two is an
          overview of the product, and section three is a summary of the
          technology and design. Much more detail on how it works can be found
          in the
          <a href="https://github.com/HarryTurner93/thea">Project GitHub</a>
          including a video demo and instructions on how to download and run for
          yourself (if you can run docker containers on your local machine).
        </p>
        <p>
          I built this system mostly as an excercise in end-to-end web system
          development with embedded ML. Building the ML model for detecting
          animals in camera traps was fun, but what I was more interested in
          this time was wrapping that model in an application that actually
          allowed an end user camera trap enthusaist to use it!
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is 10% machine learning, 50% front end and UI design and
          implementation, 30% backend system design and implementation, and
          about 20% documentation. There's some testing in there as well, don't
          worry.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have <b><i>not</i></b> deployed this system into production, partly
          because I don't want to pay out for running ML on AWS, or storing
          hundreds of Gbs of images which can get expensive quickly. That being
          said, this system could be made production ready with a couple of
          tweaks.
        </p>
        <h3>Thea</h3>
        <p>
          You are first greeted with a login screen with a faded map behind it.
          This is the actual map that the system uses to navigate and display
          cameras, it simply defaults to show Bristol and doesn't let you click
          or interact with it until you're logged in. I thought it was quite a
          nice visual effect with the frosted glass look placed over the top.
          The login will attempt to retrieve a token from the backend using the
          provided credentials, if this user doesn't exist it'll deny access. If
          it does then the returned token is stored in application state, the
          presence of the token is what triggers the login to dissapear and let
          the map show through, it looks very snazzy.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/thea/login.png" />
          <p>
            <i
              >The login screen is displayed on top of the map with a frosted
              glass effect.</i
            >
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          After logging in the user can navigate the map which uses the mapbox
          API and acts just like google maps. When the user logs in
          successfully, it retrieves from the backend any cameras stored against
          the users account and displays these on the map in their corresponding
          positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add a new camera by clicking the '+' icon in the top right, it
          then asks you to click on the map where you want it, then asks you to
          give it a name. Finally it saves this new camera to the database and
          places it on the map.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/thea/cameras.png" />
          <p>
            <i
              >The interactive map shows icons where the cameras are located.</i
            >
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          If a camera icon is clicked, it loads the details in a popout pane
          which shows the name, location, and the number of images currently
          stored against this camera, which starts off empty. You can delete the
          camera from this pane, upload images, or open the image browser to see
          the attached images as long as at least one image exists.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/thea/camera_detail.png" />
          <p>
            <i>The camera details are shown when the icon is clicked on.</i>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The user can upload images by clicking on 'Select file' which opens a
          dialog that lets them select images from their machine. If they then
          click 'Upload' it uploads these images to the backend and stores them
          against that camera. The images can then be accessed by clicking on
          'Browse Images'. Note that they can only be seen by browsing images on
          this camera, if you browse images on another camera you'll see the
          images uploaded to that one instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the user clicks 'Browse Images' they can see the images they
          uploaded. Six images are shown per page with the scores for each
          animal displayed below each image. Pagination options are in the
          bottom left allowing the user to go back and forth through the pages
          and jump to a page. At the top are three buttons that let the user
          sort by the probabilities for each animal, so clicking Fox will rank
          all the images with those with highest scores for Fox appearing first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice the 'Waiting for results...' spinner on some of the images.
          This gets shown whilst the image has not yet been processed by the
          backend. The frontend will keep polling the backend every second until
          all images on the page have their results.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/thea/browser.png" />
          <p>
            <i
              >The image browser showing the images uploaded against this
              camera.</i
            >
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>How it Works</h3>
        <p>
          In this section I'll briefly describe how I built this system, however
          more details can be found in the github
          <a href="https://github.com/HarryTurner93/thea/blob/main/DESIGN.md"
            >Design Document</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stack is composed of a Django REST application that talks to both
          PostgreSQL and S3 (although for development and demonstration I used
          localstack rather than the actual AWS S3). Django simply implements a
          few model views that let the frontend fetch cameras and images from
          the database for each user.
        </p>
        <p>
          The frontend is React + Redux + Mapbox, all written in Typescript for
          typing safety. I started using Typescript for the first time on this
          project and hated it at first because everything I typed was somehow
          incorrect. Now I love it and realised it's saving me lots of future
          issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The machine learning models run in a Celery task worker out of the
          main processing loop, this is a very simple implementation of an event
          based architecture where the Django app pushes a message onto the
          queue for every image uploaded and a worker slowly works it way
          through that queue processing the images and writing the results to
          the database. This lets the user upload images and continue on with
          their day (or continue to use the app) whilst the backend chugs along
          processing their data. They can go into the browser and watch the
          progress too.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the ML I use PyTorch. I trained a model in one of my other repos
          using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, then I deploy this model into the
          celery worker by loading it in PyTorch. It's a fairly simple
          deployment procedure, there's no model versioning or monitoring in
          place, but it's okay for small applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          This was a fun project, and one I'll likely come back to and improve
          over time. For me it acts mostly as a reference project that I can
          come back to in the future to recall how something was implemented,
          and due to the comprehensive documentation I spent a lot of time on,
          I'll be able to see my rationale as well.
        </p>

          <i><b>Side Note: Why Thea?</b></i> To make a long story short, a
          friend and I explored the possibility of building a startup a few
          years back, and whilst it didn't go anywhere, we did try out a few
          ideas of which this was one of them. That startup would have been
          called Thea.
