        <h1>Python Wordle Solver</h1>
        <p><i>30th January 2022</i></p>
        <p>
          I "got into" Wordle a couple of weeks ago. Some friends and I have a
          competition going on Whatsapp where we submit our daily scores. If
          you're reading this, I'm going to assume that you already know what
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"
            >Wordle</a
          >
          is and that you're interested in writing a computer program to play
          the game for you. Yes I know, it spoils the game, and of course it's
          cheating*, but I thought the task of building a Wordle Solver would be
          a fun and worthwhile challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, I wanted to build a solver that was simple to
          understand. It's a pure Python implementation, everything is handled
          with lists of strings and simple Python list filtering operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The code is
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/HarryTurner93/wordle_solver"
            >here</a
          >
          and is free to use, modify, etc. It has an MIT license. Follow the
          instructions on the Github README to get started.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll start by walking through a demo of the solver in action. Then
          I'll introduce the algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
          *I don't use this solver for the Whatsapp competition. Once I've
          guessed the word however, I DO check to see if the solver would have
          done better. It almost always does.
        </p>
        <h3>Demo</h3>
        <p>Spoiler: This demo is for the Wordle game on 30th January 2022.</p>
        <p>
          My first word is always <b>raise</b>. I have heard other articles
          mention this as a good starting word. It turns out that my solver also
          predicts 'raise' to be the best starting word (see
          <a href="#algorithm">Algorithm</a>
          below for details).
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/wordle/raise.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Now that we've entered the guess and received the feedback, we enter
          it into the solver. The format of the feedback is a five letter word
          consisting of '_' (underscores) for blanks, 'y' for yellow, and 'g'
          for green. In this case, we enter 'y____' for one yellow followed by
          four blanks.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/wordle/raise-solver.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The solver does it's thing and gives us the results. Notice that it's
          solving for 113 words. What this means is that the solver takes the
          original set of 2315 words, and filters out all words that don't fit
          the guess and feedback we just received. For example, we know the word
          contains an 'r' so any word that doesn't have an 'r' will be removed.
          Similar rules apply for green and blank. After running this filtering
          operation, the word set contains 113 words, any of which could be the
          answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solver then computes the value of each word. I define 'value' and
          show how to compute it in the next section. For now, the solver is
          simply saying that the word 'thorn' will, on average, reduce the size
          of the word set to 9.85 which is the smallest, so we should choose
          that as our next guess.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/wordle/thorn.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          At first glance it doesn't look great. But now is a good time to point
          out that my strategy here is not to try and match the word, but
          instead to narrow down the search space as quickly as possible. If we
          run the solver again you'll see what I mean.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/wordle/thorn-solver.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          We now have just two words left, so choosing 'thorn' as our second
          guess put us in a really good position for solving the puzzle quickly.
          Unfortunately it's now a 50/50 guess so we have no option but to pick
          one.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/wordle/finish.png" />
        </div>
        <p>Never mind, 4/6 is still not bad.</p>
        <p>
          In the next section, I cover the algorithm and the intuition behind
          it. If you just want to get started playing around with the solver,
          you can access it
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/HarryTurner93/wordle_solver"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          At the start of the game, the answer could be any of 2315 five-letter
          words. Consider choosing a word like 'wryly' as your first guess. It
          would be an excellent guess - if the answer happened to contain 'y' or
          'w'. But it probably won't because those letters aren't very common,
          so you'd likely get back blanks which wouldn't tell you very much.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, consider using a word like 'raise'. Letters like
          'a', 'e', 's' and 'r' are more common, so even though the word 'raise'
          is unlikely to be the answer, you're more likely to get matches.
          Matches are important because they narrow down the search space of
          possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Note that not only are some letters more common than others, but are
          likely to appear in certain positions, so the position of the letters
          matters as well.)
        </p>
        <p>
          What all of this means, is that some words, like 'wryly' will not
          narrow the set of possible words very much. On occasion, you may get
          lucky and hit 'y' and 'w' which considerably reduces the set of
          possible words, but most of the time you won't. On the other hand the
          word 'raise' will, on average, produce more matches than 'wryly' and
          therefore reduce the size of the set of possible words.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can therefore derive a notion of the value of a word as
          <b
            ><i
              >the average size of the reduced word list that it would
              produce</i
            ></b
          >. Our goal is then to choose the best word at each iteration
          according to this notion of value. Note that lower values are better
          here because we want to reduce the size of the word list as much as
          possible. My use of the word 'average' is important here - we don't
          know the answer yet so we have to compute the size of the reduced word
          set for all possible answers. Since each word is equally likely to be
          the answer, we average the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          This then forms the core of the algorithm. To compute the value for a
          single input word, we will have an inner function that computes the
          reduced word list for a given answer, and an outer loop that
          repeatedly calls this inner function for every possible answer. We
          then average the size of all those word lists and return that value as
          the result.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="../../images/miscellaneous/wordle/inner.png" />
          <p><i>This is how we compute the value for a single word.</i></p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The

            href="https://github.com/HarryTurner93/wordle_solver/blob/c32578ef6dd512b6b21eeceeef9b3ed33d51269c/src/wordle_solver/solver.py#L142"
            >outer loop</a
          >
          is quite trivial, it repeatedly calls the inner function and averages
          the results. The inner function is slightly more complex. To compute
          the reduced word list for a given input and answer, it has to apply
          three rules, the rule for blanks, the rule for yellows, and the rule
          for greens. It uses these rules to "knock out" invalid words. At this
          point, it's probably easier to understand what's happening by reading
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/HarryTurner93/wordle_solver/blob/c32578ef6dd512b6b21eeceeef9b3ed33d51269c/src/wordle_solver/solver.py#L46"
            >the code itself</a
          >, but this should give you the context for what this function is
          doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we have a way of computing the value for a given word on a given
          word set, we can use this to determine which word reduces the word set
          by the largest amount and therefore, the one we should choose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full 'solver' then, is a wrapper around these functions that takes
          as input the guess and the feedback from Wordle, computes the reduced
          set of words based on the feedback, and then solves for the next most
          valuable word.

          <p><i>How the solver works at a high level.</i></p>
        </div>
        <p>
          All of this is quite high level, it's best to

            >look at the code</a
          >
          directly. I've tried to make it as self-evident as possible,
          everything is in one file, it's less than 200 lines long, and half of
          those lines are comments.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The code should be easy to run so I encourage you to give a try, tweak
          it, and try and improve it. If you've got any feedback, please do
          either create an issue on Github or leave a comment below.
