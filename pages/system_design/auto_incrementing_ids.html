        <h3 id="problem">The Problem</h3>
        <p>
          We recently migrated our ML Experiment Tracking to a new system
          <a href="https://clear.ml/docs/latest/">ClearML</a>. The old
          proprietary system stored all experiments in a database using auto
          incrementing integer IDs. There were over 50,000 experiments when we
          migrated. The new system referenced experiments by a unique ID (UUID),
          which has advantages from a system design perspective but introduces
          drawbacks in usability. A UUID might look like
          <code>2b1e7e88-279c-4f42-bedc-fb46f9f79f8e</code> whereas an
          auto-incrementing ID is just a number, e.g 100, 4578, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          UUIDs are preferred in most cases since they are both more secure, and
          easier to work with in distributed systems. They’re more secure
          because they don’t tell you anything about the items in your database,
          such as their order, or number. They’re easier to work with because
          you can generate them from anywhere without having to place strong
          consistency requirements on your database.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, auto-incrementing IDs have a UX advantage, they can be easier
          to refer to, and they tell you something about the order of the items
          in the database. The team has gotten used to referring to experiments
          by their five digit ID, and asked if we could bring that functionality
          to the new system. Note that because our system is internal, the
          security risk from knowing the order of experiments is not a concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why not just refer to them by their names? Well you can, but naming is
          hard. Names can be verbose, and they're are not always unique. Even if
          they’re literally unique, they might appear to be very semantically
          similar. For example, make sure you don’t confuse
          <i>"baseline object detection train head mounted"</i> with
          <i>"head mounted baseline object detection train"</i> etc...
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the new system uses UUIDs but the team are frustrated with the
          poor usability, we can’t change them because we don’t have access to
          the database (nor do we want it, we pay them to manage that for us).
          The solution was to augment the names of the experiments which are
          editable, to inject some kind of useful identifier.
        </p>
        <h3 id="solution">The Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The ClearML API provides us a way to programmatically change names of
          experiments. After a short team consultation we opted for an approach
          that would update the name of the experiment once it started running
          and prepend an auto-incrementing number. For example, a name would end
          up looking like
          <code>5482: My Experiment</code>. This wasn't perfect, the name could
          be changed simply by editing it in the UI, so it wasn't a hard ID, but
          we were working with an internal team who were happy to follow the
          rule that you don't change the number once it's been added.
        </p>

        <p>
          To implement this, we needed a service that gave us strongly
          consistent auto incrementing numbers that we could then attach to our
          experiments (more on that shortly). At first I went down the route of
          building a microservice for this with an API that allowed fetching of
          the next ID, it would have to be backed by a database of course, so
          that all had to be created and stored. It felt like overkill for what
          is essentially just a number. So, we looked for an off the shelf
          solution to do this for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn&#39;t want to have to setup and manage my own database, so I
          picked a tool I&#39;ve used before that is both powerful, and easy to
          get started with,
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a>. I could
          easily store a single key that tracked the latest ID, and simply fetch
          that via the existing AWS SDK. But DynamoDB is not strongly
          consistent, if multiple experiments all began at the same time, would
          they all get served the same number?
        </p>
        <p>
          I then came across
          <a
            href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html#WorkingWithItems.AtomicCounters"
            >atomic counters</a
          >, which are a feature of DynamoDB that allow you to increment or
          decrement a numeric value using a single API call, but more
          importantly, they return the number they just incremented. From the
          docs:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <i>
              All write requests are applied in the order in which they were
              received. With an atomic counter, the updates are not idempotent.
              In other words, the numeric value increments or decrements each
              time you call <code>UpdateItem</code>.
            </i>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This is exactly what I needed, multiple calls to the service will all
          return the next value in the order that they were received. So the
          solution was simple, some terraform to create the table with the
          single key, then simply fetch from that table when I need the next
          value.
        </p>
        <h3>The Hook</h3>
        <p>
          The final trick was having this automatically added to experiments
          when they started. When we first began with ClearML, we introduced our
          own library that called the ClearML API under the hood. For example,
          we have a function called
          <code>create_and_setup_experiment</code> that simply starts the
          experiment on ClearML.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for exposing that functionality through our own SDK rather
          than having users just call ClearML directly, is that we now have a
          hook into the experiment creation process that we can add stuff to
          over time. This is the same pattern used in ML training frameworks
          like PyTorch/Tensorflow such as on_epoch_end, on_batch_start, etc. So
          all we needed to do was have this hook call the API to get the next
          value, and then issue an API call to update the name, and we&#39;re
          done.
        </p>
        <p>
          This solution has worked very well in practice since we implemented
          it.
        </p>
