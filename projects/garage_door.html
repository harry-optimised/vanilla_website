                    One Sunday morning a few weeks ago, I was putting together an Ikea chair with my partner, and we
                    needed a drill. I walked into the garage to grab it, and I found the garage door wide open with
                    sunlight streaming in. Damn, I thought, how long had that been open? It didn't look like anything
                    had been taken, our garage backs onto a quiet lane, so we probably got lucky. I wracked
                    my brains trying to remember at what point we might have forgotten to close it, but my
                    partner and I were certain we'd closed it the day before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The garage door is electric, so the most likely hypothesis was that we'd somehow nudged the key fob and
                    opened it accidentally, so we carried out an experiment to test this idea. I stood in the garden,
                    20m from the door, and hit the button, it opened. I went into the house and stood in the kitchen,
                    40m from the door and hit the button again, it opened. With my partner watching the garage, I went
                    into the lounge at the front of the house, over 50m from the garage and hit the button again, it
                    opened. Whoops!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I promise you this was not some Wifi enabled key fob, just a very powerful clicker! As fun as it was,
                    there was too much risk that we'd accidentally bump it and open the garage without our knowing.
                    There were lots of solutions to this problem, we could have researched the garage door model to
                    see if we could turn down the sensitivity, we could have bought an alarm, or we could have just
                    taken the key fob off and kept it somewhere we'd be less likely to bump it. We did none of those
                    things, I had something much more complicated, fun, and time-consuming in mind<sup>*</sup>.

                        <sup>*</sup>Just to be clear, normally I try very hard not to overcomplicate things, I am a big
                        fan of keeping things simple. On this occasion I wanted to deliberately play around with some
                        new technologies, hence the overkill.
