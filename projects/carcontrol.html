                <h1>Small Neural Network for Car Control</h1>
                <p><i>13th September 2017</i></p>
                <p>
                    This project was about building a small neural network that could effectively control a virtual car
                    around a track. I thought it would be an interesting challenge, especially with all the hype surrounding
                    self-driving cars at the moment. What this post demonstrates is how a very simple neural network is able
                    to control a virtual car better than any manually written control system ever could!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this post I’ll cover the architecture of the neural network, the set of sensors used as input to the
                    network and the training method which was a combination of randomised optimization and evolutionary algorithms.
                </p>
                <h3>Traditional Control vs Learning Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    I could have used more traditional control methods by writing a set of rules
                    for the car such as “<em>if there is nothing in front of me, accelerate hard”</em>, and <em>“if the wall
                        on the left stops then turn left”</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But imagine how this set of simple rules quickly grows into a large number
                    of complex rules to account for every possible situation, e.g. “<em>if there is something rapidly
                        approaching in front of me and something to the right, but not to the left and I’m travelling
                        quickly, brake hard and turn left with a radius of…</em>” and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why use a neural network? Well that’s the beauty of neural networks and
                    other machine learning algorithms, rather than explicitly hard code the rules into our car, we give it
                    the ability to learn the rules and let it figure them out on its own. It usually does a much better job
                    then we could, and it saves us the effort!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve essentially transformed the problem from that of writing a set of
                    rules to control a car into that of building a system capable of learning the rules on its own, and it
                    turns out this second problem is <em>usually</em> easier to solve.
                </p>

                <h3>Sensors</h3>
                <p>
                    I'll start with the car. The car physics models velocity and acceleration
                    only. To control the car, the control system has two things it can do. First, it can apply a force to
                    the car in the direction in which the car is facing. Think of this as the driving force from the engine,
                    which gives the control system a way of accelerating the car. The force can also be negative allowing
                    the control system to stop the car. To turn the car, the control system applies a positive/negative
                    torque to the car about a center point.
                </p>

                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/carcontrol/small_nn_car_control_forces.png"/>
                    <p><i>The two forces used to control the car.</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The translational and rotational accelerations are calculated from the two
                    forces using a specified mass and rotational inertia, and the position and rotation are calculated from
                    these accelerations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The car has 5 sensors on it, which are all distances in pixels to the
                    nearest wall in 5 different directions as shown in the picture below. These 5 distances form the input
                    vector to the network.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/carcontrol/small_nn_car_control_sensors.png"/>
                    <p><i>The five sensor directions.</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    A big lesson that I learned while doing this project is how important it is
                    to get the inputs to your network right. It doesn’t matter how complicated your network is, or how well
                    you train it. If it doesn’t have any information about the environment, it won’t do very well.
                    Intuitively, by choosing these 5 distances as input, I’m giving my network the ability to determine its
                    position on the track, which is all it really needs to navigate properly. You can imagine the sensor
                    input at the bottom right saying <em>"hey, you've got lots of space in this direction, you might want to
                        think about turning right soon!"</em>
                </p>

                <h3>Network</h3>
                <p>
                    The network is incredibly basic. The input layer has five inputs for each of
                    the five sensors. These inputs pass through two fully connected layers, the hidden layer has three
                    neurons and the output layer has two, one for the driving force of the car and one for the torque for
                    turning. Both the hidden layer and the output layer have a sigmoid activation applied to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is nothing fancy about this network, no drop out, regularisation, or
                    softmax layers. The outputs are used to directly control the car.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h3>Training</h3>
                <p>
                    Training our car to do a better job of navigating the track is a kind
                    of reinforcement learning, I say kind of because it's not actually reinforcement learning, but the problem
                    sort of has the right form - every time our network makes a decision about which way to turn, or
                    how fast to move, there is no immediate feedback telling it whether the decision was a good one. It only
                    finds out at the end of the track, or when it crashes, where it receives a reward for how far it made it
                    around the track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if the car makes it 90% the way around the track before
                    crashing, it receives a high reward. This reward tells the network that whatever it was doing to get the
                    car so far along the track was probably the right thing to do! The challenge in reinforcement learning
                    is trying to figure out exactly which actions the car took were good ones, and which ones caused it to
                    crash. This is called the credit assignment problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are lots of clever algorithms for solving those kinds of problems, I'm going implement one from
                    a class of algorithms called genetic algorithms. Rather than try and identify exactly what the car
                    was doing right, we simply create more of the cars that made it the furthest. The idea is that our new
                    "population" of cars will hopefully contain those same useful behaviours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll talk about how I tackled this challenge next.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/carcontrol/small_nn_car_control_track.png"/>
                    <p><i>The Track. To calculate a reward for the car, I simply designed the track to
                    start black and get bluer as it gets towards the end. When the car crashes, it just reads the blue
                    component of the colour of the pixel below it and uses that as the reward. Therefore, cars who crash
                    near the beginning get scores near 0, and those who crash near the end get scores closer to 255.</i></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Evolutionary Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    I'll create fifty virtual cars. Every one of those cars has its own neural
                    network brain, and I’ll give the weights of those networks random values between -1 and 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because each network is randomised, I don’t expect any of them to do a very
                    good job of controlling the car.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/carcontrol/small_nn_car_control_track_few.gif"/>
                    <p><i>The first 50 cars. Cars are represented as white dots because with fifty red triangles it
                    would be hard to see what’s going on. Also, I use fifty because it's easier to see what's happening.
                    Later I'll train with thousands.</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Okay so not too bad, but then it's not a particularly difficult track.
                    Notice that a lot of them crash almost straight away and most of them end up hovering around the start
                    point. One or two however have begun to actually make their way around the track, but don't make it much
                    further than the first corner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They're not impressing anybody with their performance at the moment, but
                    here’s the important part, some cars made it further than others! This means that whatever values were
                    used to initialise the weights in those cars produced neural networks that were slightly better at
                    controlling the cars than those who crashed straight away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After every car in the batch has crashed, I take the car which made it the
                    furthest (the car with the highest reward) and use it to generate a new population of one thousand cars.
                    If I do this correctly, the new batch of cars will be similar enough to the previously winning car that
                    they will on average, make it further than the cars in the previous batch. The cars would be getting
                    better over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each new car is generated by duplicating the neural network of the winning
                    car and adjusting every weight in its network by a very small random amount α. I can
                    vary α to produce different results. If α is small, then most of the
                    cars in the new batch will have similar behaviour. If α is large, then I’ll get lots
                    of variation in behaviour.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/carcontrol/small_nn_car_control_track_lines.gif"/>
                    <p><i>Similar Behaviour: After the first batch begins to die off, notice the long lines
                that form. I've switched from batch mode to a continuous stream and am using many more cars to illustrate the
                point more effectively. See Extensions below for more details.</i></p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    repeat this process again and again, and in each new batch, there’s always at least one car that makes it
                further than before, so each new batch is better than the batch before it. Eventually, the cars make it
                around the entire track.

                    <p><i>Making it around the whole track.
                Note that I have switched to a much more complicated track with successively tighter turns.</i></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    The project was implemented in Java/Processing, a very useful sketchbook IDE
                    with support for graphics, sounds, networking and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The neural network was implemented by hand with the forward pass carried out
                    with usual matrix multiplication.
                </p>

                <h3>Extensions</h3>
                <h5>Optimising Car Performance</h5>
                <p>
                    Once the cars have learned to complete the track, they stop learning, since
                    I can’t give them a higher reward for making it any further, but just because they complete the track,
                    doesn’t mean they did it well! To optimise their performance, I introduced a new reward, which was based
                    on how quickly they completed the race. Faster cars got better rewards. With this new reward system,
                    cars were incentivised to complete the race as quickly as possible which resulted in some very
                    interesting behaviour such as taking the optimal path around bends.
                </p>

               <h5>Batch vs Continuous</h5>
                <p>
                    In batch mode, a new population of cars is generated at the same time, and I
                    have to wait for all the cars to crash before waiting for the next batch. This was a huge waste of
                    resources. During training, I want as many cars on the track as I can! I changed the car generation
                    procedure to generate a new car every time a car crashed, which kept the maximum amount of cars on the
                    road at any one time. The new car was generated using the most recent “best car”.
                </p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>
                    The training was a success! I trained the car for a substantial amount of
                    time and for the rewards, I used both the distance progressed along the track as well as the speed at
                    which the track was completed. Look at it go!
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was a fun exercise in evolutionary learning. The neural
                    network itself isn’t going to win any awards, but the method of training the car should be mildly
                    interesting at the very least.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The big take away for me is how a simple neural network of just two layers
                    is able to give such incredible performance. Within the constraints of the car physics, it looks like
                    the car’s performance is pretty near optimum.
