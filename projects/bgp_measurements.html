                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    At 15:51 UTC on Monday 4th October 2021, major DNS resolvers around the world started
                    returning (and caching) SERVFAIL for queries to <b>facebook.com</b> because they couldn't resolve
                    Facebook's name servers. Since <b>facebook.com</b> couldn't be resolved, users everywhere lost access
                    to the app, the website, whatsapp, and many other services. Facebook was effectively disconnected
                    from the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration, but to the public internet it manifested as
                    a BGP issue. BGP is a relatively unknown, yet incredibly important internet protocol that connects
                    everything together, and I thought it would make an interesting article to try and detect the
                    Facebook outage, and demonstrate just how easy it is to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this post I introduce BGP and DNS, the two main internet technologies at the heart of
                    the incident. I explain what happened during the Facebook outage, and finally demonstrate how to
                    detect the outage with <a href="https://bgpstream.caida.org/docs/tutorials/pybgpstream">PyBGPStream</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>The Border Gateway Protocol (or BGP)</h3>
                <p>
                    Most people have heard of the Internet Protocol (IP), and understand
                    that every public host that is connected to the internet has a unique IP address. They also understand
                    that for two hosts to communicate over the network, they must send packets to each other identified
                    with those addresses, much like how you might send a letter to a friend via the postal service.
                    Whereas a postman delivering a letter is quite easy to get your head around, it's not so obvious how
                    a packet bound for a particular host on the other side of the internet actually gets there.

                    <p><i>
                        The internet is a network of networks.
                    </i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The internet is a network of networks, and each of these networks is referred to as an
                    Autonomous System. An Autonomous System (or AS) is a single administrative domain. That means that
                    one organisation is in charge of the network, they can buy and install routers wherever they want,
                    they can connect them up however they like, and store the
                    routing tables of their choice. Within a single AS, the routers will coordinate with each other
                    and learn how to send messages to other routers in the AS. In the example below, if one router is connected
                    to host A, and another router is connected to host B, then host A only needs
                    to send a packet to its local router which then sends the packet to B's router via some path it
                    has previously learned, which finally forwards it on to B. The routers in this example are simply
                    forwarding traffic by looking up the IP address in their forwarding tables and sending the packet
                    out along the appropriate fibre. Those forwarding tables are learned by the routers talking to
                    each other and telling each other about changes they're observing, everything happens within the
                    network.
                </p>
                 <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/bgp_measurements/routers.png"/>
                    <p><i>
                        Hosts within an AS will forward traffic to their local router which has learned
                        a path to the destination and knows how to forward the traffic.
                    </i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The problem is that there is no single organisation that owns the entire internet. The
                    internet is <b>not</b> one big network with lots of routers, it's made up of lots of smaller networks connected
                    together, each owned by different organisations, and each of those organisations have different
                    interests and don't necessarily want to cooperate with each other! In order for
                    a host in AS 1 to be accessible by hosts in AS 2, AS 1 must somehow advertise to AS 2 that it owns
                    this address, and AS 2 must be willing to accept and import that address and then disseminate it to
                    its internal routers so they can update their forwarding tables. The way that Autonomous Systems
                    coordinate in this way is with a protocol called the Border Gateway Protocol, or BGP.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/bgp_measurements/border_routers.png"/>
                    <p><i>
                        Hosts in two different Autonomous Systems will send traffic via the border routers.
                    </i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    BGP is a way for special routers on the edge of these AS's, called border routers, to talk to
                    each other and share information about what addresses they can reach. In the previous example,
                    host A which resides in AS 1 has a public IP address of 20.0.0.1, and AS 1 wants to share that
                    with the world so host A can deliver all the wonderful content they're producing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A border router on AS 1 will send a BGP advertisement to the border router in AS 2 saying it has
                    the address 20.0.0.1. The router in AS 2 first decides whether to accept the route, and if it does,
                    it disseminates that information through it's network of routers. This means that if any of those
                    routers want to forward traffic to 20.0.0.1, they now know that they have to first forward it to the
                    border router, which then forwards it to AS 1's border router, which then forwards it to A's local
                    router, which finally forwards it on to A.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Autonomous Systems don't just share their own addresses, they share the ones they learn as well,
                    so AS 2 will send an advertisement to AS 3 saying that it can reach 20.0.0.1, and the
                    full path will be AS 3 to AS 2 to AS 1.
                </p>
                 <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/bgp_measurements/as_path.png"/>
                    <p><i>
                        Autonomous Systems will sometimes forward advertisements that they receive to other Autonomous Systems.
                    </i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This type of BGP advertisement is called an announcement, another type is called a withdrawal
                    which says, "I am no longer advertising this route", which removes the address from all the
                    routing tables in that Autonomous System. By advertising and withdrawing routes, Autonomous Systems
                    can control what addresses are public on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facebook has it's own AS (actually it has several), which is <b>AS 32934</b>. The reason
                    Facebook have their own AS is for the same reason that Netflix, and Google have their own
                    Autonomous Systems, administrative control over the network so that they can prioritise traffic
                    for their own services. Facebook's AS is purely for Facebook traffic. When you go to <b>facebook.com</b>,
                    the traffic is routed to the nearest Facebook network entry point (a small data center) which routes
                    you onto the Facebook network, from there your traffic flows over a high capacity network backbone
                    via a series of routers to Facebook's datacenters where the request is actually fulfilled.
                </p>
                <h3>Domain Name System</h3>
                <p>
                    The Domain Name System, or DNS, is like the internet's address book. It saves human beings from
                    remembering addresses like 20.0.0.1, meaning you only need to remember <b>facebook.com</b> instead. DNS servers map
                    hostnames to addresses, and will refer to a more authoritative DNS server if they haven't got an entry in their local database. Facebook has it's own DNS server
                    specifically for anything at <b>facebook.com</b>. For example, consider the following two hostnames.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">ai.facebook.com</a></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">developers.facebook.com</a></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When you visit <b>ai.facebook.com</b>, your local machine first contacts the local DNS server
                    in your area. Assuming that <b>ai.facebook.com</b> isn't already cached, that DNS server recursively
                    queries the root <b>.com</b> DNS server which looks it up. The <b>.com</b> DNS server doesn't have an entry
                    for <b>ai.facebook.com</b> but it does have an entry for a <b>facebook.com</b> DNS server, so it refers the
                    local DNS to Facebook's DNS instead. The local DNS server then queries Facebook's DNS server for
                    <b>ai.facebook.com</b>, this time there's a match! It looks up the address and returns it to the
                    local DNS server, which returns it to your local machine. Notice how you machine doesn't really
                    know (or care) what's happening, it all happens automatically. DNS is said to be hierarchical, and
                    recursive.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/bgp_measurements/dns.png"/>
                    <p><i>
                        DNS is how your local machine resolves hostnames.
                    </i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Facebook's DNS server (actually it has several) contains IP addresses for everything at
                    <b>facebook.com</b>, it's located within Facebook's Autonomous System and it has it's own IP address
                    just like everything else. The <b>.com</b> DNS
                    server knows that IP address, and the correct routes have been advertised from Facebook's AS
                    using BGP. So when your laptop asks for something at <b>facebook.com</b>, all the routers know
                    how to route your request to the right place.
                </p>
                <h3>The Facebook Outage</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we've got the background, what actually happened? A misconfigration happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recall that Facebook have their own AS, which contains their backbone network, and their
                    datacenters. When you run a network the size of facebook's, it needs occasional maintenance.
                    Someone carried out a routine maintenance task on the backbone network and accidentally took
                    down all the connections which disconnected the datacenters from the public internet. Oops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're wondering how Facebook could have messed up that badly, it's worth remembering that
                    the internet is incredibly complex and examples like this go to show just how easy it is to knockout
                    vast amounts of infrastructure. It's also more complex than I'm suggesting here, several problems
                    happened to line up at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Facebooks DNS servers have a safety mechanism built in that will withdraw BGP routes for
                    the datacenters if the DNS server cannot talk to them. The data centers had just been taken offline,
                    so the Facebook DNS servers immediately withdrew their routes from the internet by issuing BGP
                    withdrawal advertisements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But recall that Facebook's DNS servers are also within the AS and also connected the same backbone.
                    Since the entire backbone was taken offline, the DNS servers declared themselves unhealthy and withdrew their own
                    advertisements as well, disconnecting themselves from the internet in the process!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Facebook's DNS servers unreachable, the <b>.com</b> DNS server, and all the local ones, were
                    all trying to query hostnames like <b>ai.facebook.com</b> and even just <b>facebook.com</b> and
                    all were receiving SERVFAIL in response.
                </p>
                <h1>Detection with PyBGPStream</h1>
                <p>
                    Now that we know what happened, let's see if we can detect it by monitoring BGP activity from
                    Facebook's AS throughout the event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are special "listener" servers throughout the world that simply listen to, and capture BGP
                    advertisements, and store them all in a big database.
                    <a href="https://bgpstream.caida.org/docs/tutorials/pybgpstream">PyBGPStream</a> is a library that
                    lets you playback BGP advertisements from this database for whatever period you want, whenever you
                    want, just as if you were receiving these advertisements in real time. If you don't specify any
                    filters, it will play back all BGP traffic. Although it doesn't capture everything, it gives you
                    a flavour of what's happening around the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <pre>
    stream = pybgpstream.BGPStream(
        from_time="2021-10-04 15:00:00", until_time="2021-10-04 22:00:00",
        record_type="updates",
        filter='peer 32934'
    )
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The above code sets up a stream and records from 15:00 on the 4th October to 22:00 that same evening which
                    encompasses the whole event. This is a post-event excercise, but it would be trivial to make this run
                    in an online manner and make detections in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the record type I specify 'updates' which filters out any administrative messages. Finally,
                    I specify a 'peer 32934' filter. If you recall, that's Facebook's AS, so this tells the stream
                    to only show advertisements that are coming directly from facebook, otherwise we'd be seeing
                    all advertisements from all over the web!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <pre>
    w_events = []
    a_events = []
    OFFSET = 1633360000
    for elem in stream:
        if elem.type == 'W':
            w_events.append(elem.time - OFFSET)
        elif elem.type == 'A':
            a_events.append(elem.time - OFFSET)
        print(datetime.utcfromtimestamp(elem.time).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now all we need to do is play the stream and capture events. There are lots of ways we could
                    analyse this data, and the advertisements themselves have a lot of information within them that
                    you could explore and aggregate in interesting ways. In this analysis I opt for something extremely
                    simple, I simply count how often I see a withdrawal or announcement in periods of two minutes, from
                    15:00 to 22:00. To do this I simply push the time that the advertisement occured into a list
                    and then bucket them with a histogram. The offset is simply so that the histogram axes start at 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the above method I produced the following histograms which show the number of withdrawals
                    and advertisements issued in each two minute period from 15:00 to 22:00.
                </p>

                    <img src="../images/projects/bgp_measurements/withdrawals.png"/>
                    <p><i>BGP Withdrawals</i></p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/projects/bgp_measurements/announcements.png"/>
                    <p><i>BGP Announcements.</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    What you can see from the histrogram of withdrawals is a significant spike right at 15:42 which is
                    when the trouble began. Then nothing for an hour or two whilst Facebook scramble their engineers,
                    then a series of announcements and withdrawals as the systems attempt to come back
                    online, and finally a big flurry of activity at about 22:00 as all systems return to normal.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Incidents like this highlight how neither the internet, nor Facebook, are bullet-proof. Things do
                    go wrong, and they can sometimes go wrong in interesting and illuminating ways. As individuals with
                    no access to Facebook's networks (unless you're a Facebook engineer of course), we don't just have to
                    sit on the sidelines and wait for the incident report to come out. What I hoped to show in this
                    example is how easy it can be (sometimes, not always), to grab some open source tools
                    and analyse such incidents ourselves.
