                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Harry. I'm the tech lead for the ML Platform team at <a href="https://vaarst.com/">Vaarst</a>,
                    and have oversight of the architecture, system design, and development processes of the team.
                    We're building an ML enabled data platform in the cloud to allow our customers to intelligently manage,
                    analyse, and deliver geo-referenced offshore data to their own customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This isn't a website about that, however. I work on personal projects in my spare time and read
                    things that interest me, mostly around Machine Learning and System Design. My passion is designing
                    and building systems with ML at their core, and it's what I'm focussing my career around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This blog is a place to capture thoughts and ideas relating to that goal, somewhere to keep track
                    of progress, to reflect and write things down that I've learned along the way. Although I'm
                    doing it for me, I'm making it public in case anything here is of use to somebody else.
                </p>
