                  I recently started using Github Copilot (yea, yea, I know.. I'm so late to the party, better late than never though).
                  Seriously though I really like it.
                <p>
                <p>
                  So far I've used it with Python/Django, and also TypeScript/React.
                  My initial impression is that it works very well for React, but slightly less well for Python (but still impressive), however I need to give it more time.
                  By "works well" I mean that it generates the code I had in mind, which usually requires a semantic understanding of the code around it.
                  I suspect it's because React components often follow common patterns and contain a lot of boilerplate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite only using it for a few days, I've discovered a few things that make it work better.
                  To start with, give your variables and functions clear and unambiguous names that reflect their purpose. 
                  Of course, this is good practice anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's also important to use type hints for languages that don't support strong static typing. 
                  I work most often with Python and JavaScript, both well known for playing fast and loose with types.
                  For JavaScript, I will use TypeScript and define types wherever possible.
                  For Python, I will add type annotations for both parameters and return types.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another way I coax good results is to write informative comments.
                  I am in two minds about this because I'm a firm believer that comments should explain why the code is the way it is, not what it does (that should be obvious from the code).
                  A good middle ground is to describe the function of the code at a high level, especially when written as a Docstring. 
                  This, plus good names and type hints are usually enough for Copilot to figure out what I want.
                  If the redundancy of the comments bothers you, you can always delete them afterwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So far I have mostly been using autocompletion mode which prompts as I type, much like autocomplete in Gmail.
                  This feels a lot more natural.
                  I rarely use "request completion" mode as it can take a while, and breaks me out of my flow, though I might experiment with it for longer code generation tasks like unit tests.
                </p>                    
                <p>
                  Most of these practices are good coding habits anyway.
                  A good framing is to treat Copilot as a novice programmer who is trying to understand your code, anything we can do to make it easier for them (or us in the future) to understand our code is a good thing.
                  It just so happens that those same practices make Copilot work better.
