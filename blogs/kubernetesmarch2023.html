                <h1>Setting up a Home Kubernetes Cluster using Ubuntu 22.04 and Kubeadm</h1>
                <p><i>26th March 2023</i></p>
                
                <p>
                  I spent a few hours setting up a cluster on some cheap hardware I picked up from a local reuse shop.
                  I wanted to write down the process I followed so that others are able to do the same.
                  There are plenty of decent guides already out there, but I didn't find any that covered the whole process from start to finish.
                  Therefore, in the spirit of <i>building on the shoulders of giants</i> I am contributing this short guide which connects a few existing guides and fills in some of the gaps!
                </p>

                <p><i>This is a guide on setting up a multi-node Kubernetes cluster using Kubeadm, on Ubuntu 22.04, as of March 2023.</i></p>
               
                <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
                <p>
                  A cluster is, by definition, composed of multiple nodes.
                  You can of course use Raspberry Pis, but I wanted something slightly more powerful, so I want to share the following "top tip".
                  In Bristol, UK, there is a shop called <a href="https://bristolwastecompany.co.uk/reuse/">Reuse</a> who take stuff that people have thrown away at the dump and sell it for pennies.
                  For whatever reason, local companies throw away all sorts of perfectly good hardware, and I've been able to pick up a few reasonable machines on the cheap.
                  Are they reliable? Probably not, but running apps reliably on top of cheap, unreliable hardware is the whole point of Kubernetes.
                  Presumably there are similar shops in other countries.
                </p>

                </div>
                <h3>Machine Setup</h3>
                <p>
                  I installed a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 on all machines, using the standard USB installation method.
                  This guide, <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ubuntu-22-04-lts">How to Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Desktop</a> is good, although note that you may not need to add a swap partition since the default Kubernetes installation will not use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All machines are networked via cable.
                  You could use WiFi, but wired is faster and more reliable for a cluster.
                  I gave each machine a static IP address, you can do this in the networking settings GUI or using a tool like <code>nmcli</code>.
                  Follow <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/nmcli-configure-network-connection/">How to Configure Network Connection Using ‘nmcli’ Tool</a> which worked on Ubuntu 22.04, I took the values for the default gateway from my existing connection.
                  You can optionally change the hostname of each machine if you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I installed <code>openssh-server</code> on each machine to allow me to use SSH. 
                  This made it easy to have three terminals open in front of me later on to do the actual K8s installation from one screen.
                  The top ranked google result, <a href="https://www.f>This guide<osslinux.com/78569/install-and-enable-openssh-on-ubuntu.htm">Install and Enable OpenSSH on Ubunutu</a> is a perfectly fine tutorial, however be careful if it mentions enabling <code>ufw</code> as you'll also need to ensure the correct ports are open for Kubernetes. 
                  <code>ufw</code> stands for <i>uncomplicated firewall</i>, and is a simple firewall tool for Ubuntu.
                  If your worker nodes can't communicate with the master node, double check your <code>ufw</code> settings.
                </p>
                <h3>Installing Kubernetes</h3> 
                <p>
                  With all three machines setup, I opened three terminals (I used tmux, although you could just open three windows) and SSH'd into each machine from my laptop.
                  The guide I followed is <a href="https://devopscube.com/setup-kubernetes-cluster-kubeadm/">How To Setup Kubernetes Cluster Using Kubeadm</a>.  
                  This guide is very good, and it worked for my setup. 
                  I only changed a few bits on the networking because of the subnet my nodes were on.
                </p>
                <h5>Networking</h5>
                <p>
                  The DevOpsCube guide proposes a 10.X.X.X network for the nodes and 192.168.X.X for the pods, however my nodes were all on my local 192.168.X.X network.
                  To get around this, I placed the nodes on the 192.168.0.X subnet when I specified their static IPs, and configured the pod networking range to be 192.168.128.0/17. 
                  This funky CIDR notation still gives me over 32,000 addresses for pods, whilst <u>not overlapping with the node subnet</u>. 
                  The pod networking range must be specified when you start the control plane in the <code>POD_CIDR</code> environment variable.
                  I also followed different instructions when installing Calico because I needed to edit the configuration.
                  Instead of applying the resource specified in the DevOpsCube guide, I followed the Calico installation instructions in the <a href="https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/getting-started/kubernetes/self-managed-onprem/onpremises">Calico docs</a>.
                  These instructions will first instruct you to download an operator and a custom resource file, you can change the pod network range in this custom resource file.
                  Finally, you create Calico using that custom operator.
                  I had to restart the <code>coredns</code> deployment before the pods would run.
                </p>
                <h3>Success</h3>
                <p>
                  I followed that guide to the end and was able to get a working cluster.
