                <h1>On Not Burning Out</h1>
                <p><i>20th January 2021</i></p>
                <p>
                    This is a short story of my personal experience. It is a reminder to myself that balance in life is important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I deliberately called this post On <i><b>Not</b></i> Burning Out, because I don't believe I have
                    ever fully burned out. But I have come close several times, and recently it happened again. Despite
                    the experience being a stressful one, I consider myself lucky, because it served as a sharp reminder
                    that I need to keep things in check, and it's only now that I have the time to think about and
                    appreciate the lesson, that I realise how important it really is. It's so important, that I'm
                    writing this post as a reminder, mostly for future me, but for others as well. We could all do
                    with such a reminder every now and again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I, like a lot of people, like to be ambitious and sometimes bite off more than I can chew.
                    Last year was one of those times, and for the nine months from March to December 2020, I slowly
                    committed to more and more and increased my involvement in those commitments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of November, it was beginning to burn me out, and things were starting to slip. The
                    funny thing about committing to a lot is that when it's all going smoothly, you have the
                    illusion of control, but when just one commitment starts to become volatile, you quickly realise
                    how <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/05/Too-Efficient">little capacity</a>
                    you have to absorb that volatility. One of my biggest commitments unexpectedly blew up in my face,
                    and because I was so invested, I had no choice but to stick it out - at the expense of everything
                    else. Had I not packed my time as fully as possible, I would have been fine, but instead, my other
                    commitments floundered, my mental health suffered, and my energy and enthusiasm took a dive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, the Christmas break forced me to take a natural pause. I was surprised by how long it
                    took me to recover, I didn't bounce back in the space of a few days, I went through several mental stages
                    of recovery before I began feeling like myself again. So far this year, I have
                    slowed my pace down just a little,
                    and it has given me time to think and reflect on what I'm doing. Now
                    I want to share a few benefits I've noticed in myself.
                </p>

                    By slowing down and reflecting on my experience as I go, I've noticed that I am better at what I do. I have
                    time to just sit and consider what I'm trying to accomplish, I can read more around the topic, and
                    think about it more deeply. Because I'm thinking more deeply, I have
                    noticed that I have more spontaneous ideas, and those ideas are usually more creative and insightful.
                    Ironically, this makes me do better and faster work than I would achieve by simply working harder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've become a nicer person. I have more patience for people and more compassion. I remember that
                    towards the end of last year, when doing something as simple as going to the supermarket, I would get internally
                    mad at people for being slow or blocking the aisle. I'd rationalise the response by telling myself that
                    I worked really hard and therefore didn't deserve to have these idiots stress me out more than I already
                    was. Of course, the world doesn't work like that. Now I just smile, it doesn't bother me. I've noticed
                    that I'm more in control of my emotions when I have time to deal with them properly. All my relationships
                    have benefitted as a result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm happier, and I enjoy my work. I've rediscovered that craftsman-like
                    passion for making things. I've remembered that the purpose of my life is not simply to
                    <a href="https://longreads.com/2020/09/08/out-there-on-not-finishing/">produce and achieve
                    as much as I can</a>, at some point I should try and enjoy myself along the way, otherwise, what am I
                    doing it all for? The funny thing is, when you're racing at a hundred miles an hour, you don't
                    have time to remind yourself of such things when those are precisely the things you need
                    reminding of most.
                </p>

                    I am not a psychologist. I am not a mental health expert. I am not qualified to tell you how to
                    live your life. I'm just one person who's slowly understanding the value of balance, and I hope I can
                    inspire you to do the same.
