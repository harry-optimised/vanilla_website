                <p>
                    Turning thirty is one of those milestones that make a lot of people
                    nervous. Like it's some sort of sacred threshold that says
                    you're not young anymore -  you better have your life figured out by
                    now and be well on your way to success and fulfillment! As if...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I turn thirty in a few weeks, right on cue, I have begun to think
                    about what I've done with my life... and what I want to do with it
                    next. In this post I want to focus on just one of the thoughts I've had,
                    possibly the biggest one, the sobering knowledge that I have a finite
                    amount of time left, and that there is an opportunity cost to everything I
                    do. It's a depressing thought, but bear with me, this post
                    turns out to be positive, I promise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was younger, I thought I had all the time in the
                    world, but as I've gotten older, I have become acutely aware of time
                    passing. I realised that if I want to make the best use of my time, then
                    it means that at any particular moment, I must make sure that I'm doing
                    the most important thing. Anything else is a waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is not a post about figuring out what that most important thing is,
                    that's a very difficult thing to do and I don't have an answer to it.
                    Instead, this is a post about efficiency, about simply being aware of where
                    I'm spending my time, because I've noticed that if I don't pay attention to
                    it, I waste it.
                </p>

                <h3>Introducing 'Balance'</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm an engineer by training, so naturally I had to start by making a
                    spreadsheet, which I have nicknamed 'Balance'. It's a method for tracking
                    where I spend my time with the aim of helping me question whether it's
                    time well spent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first define a set of values, which are
                    things that are important to me, like `building and creating things`,
                    'physical health', 'family' etc. Then I 'log' activities that
                    contribute to those values. The spreadsheet tracks how much I've
                    contributed to each of my values and begins to weight more heavily those
                    things that seem to be getting neglected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example spreadsheet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is not about meticuluously tracking everything I do, life is too
                    messy for that. For the record, I don't agonise over whether a trip to the
                    pub with a
                    friend counts as 2 or 3 points towards being social, or whether reading
                    that book improved my mental well being, or broadened my horizons etc. The
                    point of the exercise is that it allows me to express in fairly general
                    terms that this set of values is important to me, and to capture, also in
                    general terms, how where I spend my time relates to those values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What has ended up happening is that the spreadsheet is beginning
                    to reveal things about what I said was important vs what I actually end up
                    doing.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center">
                    <i>"Oi, you said physical health was important, but you've not done
                        anything about it for weeks, what gives?"</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I began by specifying a set of values that I decided were important to me.
                    I then weighted them by how importance I thought they were, the original
                    assigment was quite arbitrary. If I don't do any activities that contribute
                    to those values, then over time they start to become more heavily weighted
                    and begin to turn red. When something becomes very red, I begin to question
                    whether I should really be doing more towards it.. or perhaps it wasn't
                    important to me after all. So I often just down weight those values. This
                    has resulted in an interesting result where the weights I have on the
                    now are based on my actions, NOT what I thought was important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also tried using it for work. As a tech lead I have multiple
                    responsibilities, including supporting customers, ensuring technical
                    quality, maintaining system health. I've noticed areas that I rely on as a
                    crutch, things that I'll default to doing because it feels productive or
                    worthwhile, but actually when considered against everything else I'm being
                    lazy and procrastinating. For example, it's important to pay down technical
                    debt and keep code quality high, but I find this fun and easy to do so I do
                    a lot of it, but actually it's just as important to be thinking
                    strategically about what we want to do next. The spreadsheet has forced me
                    to spend time on those activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It feels weird to be running my life via a spreadsheet and I won't keep
                    this up indefinitely, it's simply an experiment, but it's been enlightening
                    to find out more about myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what does it mean to always be doing the most important thing? On being
                    efficient. Not mechanical, not tracking  every second of every day
                    (link to efficiency article), not about chasing metrics or achieving a
                    good score - but instead just being more conscious of
                    where I spend my time, and try to achieve a bit more
                    balance across the important areas of my life.
