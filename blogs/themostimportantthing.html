                <h1>The Most Important Thing</h1>
                <p><i>16th December 2022</i></p>

                <p>
                    Turning thirty is one of those milestones that make a lot of people
                    nervous. Like it's some sort of sacred threshold that says
                    you're not young anymore -  you better have your life figured out by
                    now and be well on your way to success and fulfillment! As if...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I turn thirty in a few weeks and right on cue, I have begun to think
                    about what I've done with my life... and what I want to do with it
                    next. In this post I want to focus on one of the thoughts I've had,
                    possibly the biggest one, that I have a finite
                    amount of time left and that there is an opportunity cost to everything I
                    do. At first glance this seems rather depressing, but it's not. It's
                    actually quite clarifying and something I plan to pay attention to more
                    often.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was younger, I thought I had all the time in the
                    world, but as I've gotten older, I have become more aware of time
                    passing. Naturally then, if I want to make the best use of my time, then that
                    means that at any particular moment I should make sure that I'm doing the
                    most important thing (whatever that is).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is not a post about figuring out what that most important thing is,
                    that's a difficult thing to do and I don't have an answer to it.
                    Instead, this is a post about becoming aware of where
                    I'm spending my time, because I've noticed that if I don't pay attention to
                    it, I tend to waste it.
                </p>

                <h3>Introducing 'Balance'</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm an engineer by training, so obviously I started by making a
                    spreadsheet, which I have nicknamed 'Balance'. In short, Balance is a
                    method for both tracking where I spend my time, and suggesting what I
                    should maybe do next. Its purpose is to help me discover whether what I'm
                    doing is time well spent. Let me briefly explain how it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first define a set of personal values, which are
                    things that are important to me, like <i>building and creating things</i>,
                    <i>health</i>, or <i>family</i>. I can assign numbers to these
                    values that capture how important a value is, relative to the others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then log activities that contribute to those values in some way. An
                    activity can contribute towards multiple values, and can contribute a
                    little, or a lot. The spreadsheet tracks how much I've
                    contributed to each value over time, and begins to weight more heavily those
                    values that seem to be getting neglected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Activities are ranked by scoring them on how much they <i>would</i>
                    contribute towards the values. For example, if I have a value called <i>
                    Health</i>, then I could create an
                    activity called <i>Running</i> that contributes positively towards it. If I
                    don't do any physical activity, and assuming there are no other activities
                    that contribute towards <i>health</i>, then over time the <i>Health</i> value
                    will become more heavily weighted, and the <i>Running</i> activity will in
                    turn become higher priority until I can't ignore it any longer.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img width="50%" src="../images/blogs/themostimportantthing/spreadsheet.png"/>
                    <p><i>Example spreadsheet. Notice how Run is ranked as highest priority
                    because the health value is the most heavily weighted. All values are
                        of the same importance in this example.</i></p>
                </div>
                <h3>Experiments & Insights</h3>
                <p>
                    Let me pause here and clarify that this was not about meticulously tracking
                    everything I do, life is too messy for
                    that. The point of the exercise was that it allowed me to express in fairly
                    general terms that a set of values was important to me, and to capture,
                    also in general terms, how where I spent my time contributed to fulfilling
                    those values. I therefore set up a qualitative experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I hoped to achieve was to learn a little about myself. I was
                    essentially declaring what I thought was important to me, and I assumed
                    that I was already using my time effectively. I expected that I was
                    naturally doing the things at the top of the list, and that my activities
                    would generally line up with the spreadsheet. It turned out I was wrong.
                </p>
                <h5>Misalignment</h5>
                <p>
                    The first thing I discovered was that the things I said were important,
                    were not the things that I actually spent my time on. I originally
                    down-weighted the importance of being social because I wanted to focus on
                    activities such as finishing my degree and building up skills for my job.
                    All the social activities were therefore near the bottom of the list, but I
                    was doing them anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could figure out the actual importance I was assigning to <i>being
                    social</i> by increasing it until the value weightings balanced out.
                    It turned out it was of fairly high importance after all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given that what I was doing was misaligned with what I had declared was
                    important, I wanted to figure out whether I was simply lying to myself
                    about the initial importance of the values, or whether they were
                    aspirational and the reality was that I was procrastinating.
                </p>
                <h5>Procrastinating</h5>
                <p>
                    It turned out it was a mixture of both. Some values were poorly
                    assigned to start with, and the early results challenged those importance
                    weightings. It didn't take long for them to converge to stable values. After
                    that, I assumed any deviations were because I was being lazy and defaulting
                    to activities that were easier. I learned that my default activity was to
                    read Instapaper articles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instapaper is a tool I use for collecting and organising blog posts. One of
                    my values is <i>Learning</i>, and reading Instapaper articles directly
                    contributes to it.  On the surface it felt productive, and reading blog
                    posts and technical articles is fun and interesting. Another of my values
                    is my <i>Mental Health</i>, and one of my activities that contributes
                    towards it is <i>Meditation.</i> The problem is that I find getting
                    started with meditation quite difficult, so I don't do it very often.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It quickly became apparent that Instapaper was a crutch. As my activities
                    contributed towards <i>Learning</i>, reading Instapaper articles became
                    lower and lower priority. So what did I do in response? I simply bumped up
                    the importance of <i>Learning</i> to counter it. I kept this up until the
                    importance I had assigned to learning was ridiculously high. I took a step
                    back and asked myself whether <i>Learning</i> was really five times more
                    important than my mental health, four times more important than being
                    healthy, and so on. I decided the answer was no, so I dialed the importance
                    back down, and then promptly sat on a meditation cushion and tried to start
                    clearing my mind.
                </p>
                <h3>The 'Balance' App</h3>
                <p>
                    As the experiment continued, one of the major areas of friction was that
                    constantly logging to a spreadsheet is tedious and time-consuming,
                    even when using Google Sheets on mobile. What I needed was
                    something faster, more user-friendly, and features like a timing
                    mode that could log increments of activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ended up building myself a mobile app that had these features so that I
                    could log activities more easily. I built it with the Xano no-code tool and
                    React Native, so it didn't take that long.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img width="40%" src="../images/blogs/themostimportantthing/app.png"/>
                    <p><i>Actual screenshot from my Balance iOS app. It lets me log activities in
                        one hour, half
                        hour, and timed intervals.</i></p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Most Important Thing</h3>
                <p>
                    The experiment was both fun, and illuminating, and I'm still using the app
                    to track my time. That being said, I don't run my life via spreadsheet,
                    it's far too messy for that and the simple algorithm underlying the method
                    isn't capable of modelling all the details that go into figuring out what
                    is truly important in my current context.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important thing about this experiment then, is that it has made me
                    conscious of how I spend my time. I said at the beginning that
                    I'm becoming more aware of time passing, and that I would pay more
                    attention to the opportunity cost of the activities I undertake. To
                    that end, Balance is simply a tool that helps me do just that, and discover
                    where those costs might lie. It challenges me to be thoughtful with my time,
                    and I'm going to keep at it, for now.
                </p>
