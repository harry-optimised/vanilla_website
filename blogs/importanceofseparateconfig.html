                    I metaphorically shot myself in the foot the other day. I took a shortcut
                    which I thought would be harmless but ended up wasting almost half a day
                    tracking down a particularly nasty bug, unfortunately all
                    self-inflicted. I'll describe the bug first, then end with a short
                    discussion on my "shortcut" and how it should have been done properly.
                </p>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    I have an application called the Processor (I can't give the fullname as
                    it's commercially sensitive). The Processor is launched onto AWS Batch as a
                    short running job that connects to an SQS queue to pull off work items and
                    process them. The work items would come in sets all related to each other,
                    and the output would be a set of artifacts for that set. So for example,
                    the Processor might see work items A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and spit out A9 and
                    A10 as a result, then it might see B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 and spit out B9 and
                    B10. Generally it was a very basic stream processing system and looked
                    something like the following.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/blogs/importanceofseparateconfig/system.png"/>
                    <p><i>Visual Depiction of the Process.</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I launched the application and everything appeared to work. I added
                    monitoring and decided to check that the relevant outputs were being
                    produced. To my surprise I found that the Processor was only outputting
                    some expected artifacts.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/blogs/importanceofseparateconfig/missing_outputs.png"/>
                    <p><i>What I Observed.</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This is bizarre I thought to myself. I checked the queue and confirmed that
                    all the expected inputs were flowing through it. They were even being taken
                    off the queue at regular intervals. It must be the Processor I thought, so
                    I spun up an instance locally, captured a copy of the input work items and
                    played them back through the Processor on my local machine. Everything
                    worked perfectly and all the outputs were produced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it worked fine locally, but in the cloud it was missing half of the
                    outputs. I added some logs to the Processor and discovered that it was only
                    processing some inputs, and yet they were all being taken off the
                    queue. It was as if a phantom processor was secretly taking them off the
                    queue as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then it hit me. We had a separate testing environment which runs a
                    full copy of our production system (albeit on fewer resources). I checked
                    the testing environment and sure enough, there was <i>another</i> copy of
                    the Processor, <b><i>pulling from the same queue.</i></b>
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/blogs/importanceofseparateconfig/hidden.png"/>
                    <p><i>What was Really Happening.</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I had hard-coded the queue identifier for the Processor so that no matter
                    where the application was launched, it would connect to the production
                    queue of work items. The output queue <i>was configured correctly</i> which
                    is why I wasn't seeing the outputs, they were being sent to the output
                    queue in the test environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made the queue identifier a configuration value and updated the test
                    environment processor to use its test input queue, and everything began to
                    work properly.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    As soon as I observed the second Processor I knew what I'd done wrong. I
                    know how important it is to not bake configuration into your applications.
                    I had rushed and hard coded it in order to move fast, and that had
                    backfired and I ended up wasting my own time. Separate your configuration
                    from the application!
                </p>
