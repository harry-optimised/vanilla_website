                <p><i>July 2021</i></p>
                <p>
                    Rapid non stop learning. Not a proper curriculum, just what I did and what I learned. Anki.

                </p>
                <h3>Trigger</h3>
                <p>
                    Promotion at work. Build a data driven ML system in the cloud. Leading the team. AWS. The need
                    to get good quick. Existing knowledge, stuff from Thea.
                </p>
                <h3>Networking</h3>
                <p>
                    Networking for Sys Admins. Great book for beginners. OMSCS Networking course, very detailed, too detailed.
                    Did actually teach me how the internet worked though.
                </p>
                <h3>NGINX, and Auth0</h3>
                <p>
                    Triggered by use of NGINX as a JWT validator. Quickly learned about Auth0 and JWT tokens and
                    fitting them into NGINX.
                </p>
                <h3>Kubernetes</h3>
                <p>
                    Anticipation of DevOps. EKS bootcamp.
                </p>
                <h3>Django & Celery</h3>
                <p>
                    New backend guy, application rewrite. Painful but true. Django and Celery, better architectures.
                </p>
                <h3>First Foray into System Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Designing Data Driven Applications. Good but lots of low level detail, stopped half way, will return.
                </p>
                <p><b>Designing Distributed Systems</b></p>
                <p>
                    This was a shortish book at 150 pages, that describes itself as a book of design patterns for
                    distributed systems. I found it useful beause it started to make practical some of the concepts I'd
                    learned about in Designing Data Driven Applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, it descibes the load balancer pattern as having one node distribute
                    requests evenly amongst a set of other worker nodes. That's conceptually what a load balancer does, but
                    you can implement this easily in Kubernetes using just a simple ClusterIP service and a replicated set of pods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another example is the sharding pattern. I know what sharding is having read the Designing Data Driven
                    Applications book, but I wasn't sure how you might actually implement it until now. Turns out you can
                    spin up an NGINX server on a node in a Kubernetes cluster with an upstream using ip hash. The ip hash
                    means clients will get directed to the same node each time. You can then create three backends with
                    something like Redis running on them and provide
                    the names to the upstream and it will shard requests between them. You've effectively built a sharded
                    Redis server. It's not the most sophisticated solution and it isn't replicated, but you can see how
                    the concept of sharding is being implemented. It made the conceptual idea of sharding a lot more
                    concrete for me and there's a lot to be said for that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was well timed book because it introduced and explained topics I knew about (from
                    reading most of Data Driven Applications) using technologies that I also knew about (Kubernetes and NGINX),
                    so it was a surprisingly easy book to read. It also referred to Kafka, which I didn't know about,
                    but I'll get to that later.
                </p>
                <p><b>Understanding Distributed Systems</b></p>
                <p>
                    This was very much a "tie concepts together" kind of book. There wasn't enough detail to actually
                    go and implement something, but it covered an awful lot of ground. I guess you could call it a
                    <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/">tree book</a> if the analogy
                    can be stretched that far. Having read Data Driven Applications, I found that I was already
                    familiar with about 80% of the content, but it was good to see how it all fitted together.
                    I'll read this one again multiple times I think as way of solidifying the concepts.
                </p>
                <p><b>Seven Databases in Seven Weeks</b></p>
                <p>
                    I'd seen this book previous and liked the idea of it, also two of three of those seven were PostgreSQL,
                    DynamoDB, and MongoDB, all of which we now use at work. Seemed like as good a time as any to get on top
                    of those.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now finished, I didn't do the exercises, I just read through, it was a good whirlwind tour of seven
                    very different databases that I now feel like I know alot better rather than them just being names.
                    Redis, DynamoDB, MongoDB, and PostGRES are all databases I use regularly but haven't really understoof
                    what they were about until now. The Neo4J was interesting, I'd like to try that, and CouchDB and HBase
                    I can't see myself using just yet but was good to know that they exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The book was easy to understand, but a lot of content. It referred back regularly to concepts from SD
                    such as replication, sharding, multi leader, single leader etc. It was good to see how modern databases
                    put those concepts into practice, and it also made it very clear the different tradeodds databases
                    must make and why they choose what they choose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PostgreSQL, SQL
                </p>
                <h3>gRPC</h3>
                <p>
                    Trigger, used at work between Django backend and a microserver. Hadn't come across before and wondered why
                    not REST. Then after reading Understanding Distributed Systems it talked about APIs and how REST is typically
                    used between server and clients, but Interprocess Communication (IPC) is used between services within an organisation
                    the most common one being gRPC. That's two signals that it's a worthwhile technology to learn, so I went and looked it up.
