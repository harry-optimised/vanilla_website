                <h1>The Mentorship Scam</h1>
                <p><i>21st May 2020</i></p>
                <p>
                    A few months ago, I almost got tricked into joining a pyramid scheme. I don't consider myself
                    someone who usually falls for that sort of thing but that's probably why I almost did.
                    I'm writing this now because I thought it would be an
                    interesting lesson worth sharing, mostly so that others don't also fall into the same trap. I'm writing
                    it as a story, sprinkled throughout with some of my observations in hindsight. I hope you find it enlightening.
                </p>
                <h3>The Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    It all started with Toastmasters. Toastmasters is an international organisation of public speaking clubs,
                    with clubs all around the world, including two in Bristol, UK where I live. The meetings are opportunities to
                    practice and get better at public speaking, as well as to develop basic leadership skills by taking on
                    different roles within the club. Toastmaster clubs attract a variety of people, but mainly they attract
                    those looking to develop themselves in some way, and therefore it's not uncommon to find people there who
                    read lots of books, deliberately push and stretch themselves, and who are generally open to new
                    opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I joined Toastmasters in September 2019. After having attended a few meetings, I ended up finally doing a short
                    speech in which I introduced myself to the club, and during the speech, I mentioned a few interesting
                    books I'd read along the way. During the short break
                    afterwards, I was immediately approached by a guy about my age, he had a big grin on his face and introduced
                    himself as Pete.</p>
                <p>
                    <i>"I loved your speech".</i> He said. <i>"I wanted to say that I'm also a big reader, what
                    have you read recently?"</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    He seemed nice enough, and we quickly got talking about books, speeches, toastmasters, and self-development in general.
                    After the meeting, the members moved to a nearby pub to catch up with each other, and Pete and I sat down in a corner.
                    I asked what he was reading at the moment and he pulled out a book called "Outwitting the Devil", by Napolean Hill. I'd not
                    read it, but I knew of the author. I asked him where he'd heard of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"My mentors recommended it to me".</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was intrigued. <i>"Who are your mentors"?</i> I asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"Just a group of like-minded people all helping each other to improve, develop their finances, and achieve their goals." </i>
                     He stopped and waited as if expecting me to ask to join. I didn't know what to make of it, it was unusual,
                    but I have to admit I was curious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"That sounds.. interesting. What's it all about?"</i> I said, and then things really got interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pete told me about a young couple called Dom and Karina Mckenna who live in Australia, they were in their early 30s and had
                    already retired, having started <i>"building financial assets"</i> in their late 20s. They now lived a life of
                    pleasure and adventure and spent their days realising their goals, reading books, travelling to exotic
                    places, and generally living the lives of their dreams. Great for them I thought. Pete then told me how
                    they were dedicating their lives to helping others also achieve that same life by developing their
                    own <i>"financial assets"</i>, and that this was in the form of a mentorship group where those who had achieved results in the
                    areas of your interest would help you do the same. I was intrigued by the assets, so I asked about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"All I can tell you is that my mentors are helping me to build my own business. I help other
                        companies set up their supply lines, and take a share of the profit"</i>, he said.
                        That didn't really explain much, that's just the definition of a franchise, I thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"Well, how's it going?"</i> I asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"I'm 2 years away from the point where my business will take care
                    of itself, and then I'll be able to stop my job"</i>, he replied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It all sounded very impressive, and I'll be completely honest here, I wanted to get involved, so I asked. He paused for a
                    second, then said, <i>"Well, I can't just invite you into the group. But if you're interested I can ask
                    my mentors to see if they'd be willing to meet with you?"</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"Please, that would be great"</i>, I replied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pete smiled, <i>"Brilliant, I'll let you know what they say."</i>
                </p>

                <h3>Hook, Line, and Sinker</h3>

                <p>I heard nothing for two weeks, then eventually I get a text from somebody called Jack.</p>
                <p><i>Hi Harry it's Jack here, Pete asked me to give you a call as you were asking him lots of questions about our
                mentorship group. I'll be free for you to ring me back after 8pm this evening or Saturday after 3pm. Thanks!</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I requested the 8pm time slot. Notice the time slots are either evenings and weekends.
                    This is always the case as they always have full-time jobs. So much for retirement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two week delay was not the first time they made me wait, I'm now tempted to think that the long delays
                    and the very specific timeslots are part of a psychological/sales strategy. Then again, he might just
                    be a busy guy. As the day approached, I actually felt nervous, remember that I still knew basically
                    nothing at this point. I expected the call to be some sort of initial interview, and the only questions
                    I knew they'd be bound to ask were <i>"Why do you want to be in our mentorship group?"</i> and
                    <i>"Why should we let you in?"</i>, so I prepared answers just in case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At 8pm, I called Jack, and as predicted, it was an interview. Jack mostly asked me questions about what kind
                    of person I was, whether I set myself goals, and whether I achieved them. He asked what books I'd read and why,
                    and what I did for a living. It wasn't a one-way chat, I asked him lots of questions in return and he answered them, he
                    genuinely did seem friendly and all in all it was a fun conversation. I was struck by how young he was, he said he was 24, and having now
                    researched him, I believe he was telling the truth. He seemed to be ambitious, sure of himself, cocky even, and that he
                    knew what he wanted and was going after it. He seemed exactly how I expected someone part of such a
                    mentorship group would be. I wasn't surprised, I've met lots of people like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Naturally, I asked Jack lots of questions about the mentorship group, and in particular about these elusive
                    <i>"financial assets"</i>, of course, he was just as vague as Pete had been. He did, however, tell me not to
                    worry just yet,
                    they didn't just share their secrets with anybody, they expect commitment first and then put you
                    on what is effectively a training program. Fair enough, I thought. He asked whether I would be receptive
                    to taking part in such a training program? I said yes, and meant it if it was going to teach me how I
                    could get the same results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, you might be thinking, <i>"Ha, what a naive fool, it's obviously too good to be true, I'd
                    never fall for something like that!"</i> and you might be right. But let me try and explain what my state of mind
                    was at the time so you can compare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basically, I was roped in
                    by the idea of the mentorship scheme. Right now I'm very into self-development, and I'm not talking about the wishy
                    washy self-help type stuff that has you chant <i>"I will be successful"</i> over and over every night, and hang
                    dream boards all over your walls (I'm not judging that style of self-help, I'm just not into it), I mean instead
                    that I read books on psychology because it's good to understand how people work, I joined toastmasters because
                    I was crap at public speaking and wanted to get better, I'm doing a masters degree in my spare time because I want
                    to learn more about Computer Science, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, a sensible and natural idea is that the best way of getting better at something is to have a mentor
                    that is already an expert at that thing so that they can guide you, point out mistakes, and make your learning generally
                    much more efficient. This is basically what all apprenticeships are, and it works very well. Want to get better at running?
                    Go make friends with someone who is very good at running, runs regularly, and wins races. Then find out what they do and
                    copy it. I'm not saying this works 100% every time but it's not a bad place to start. Also, I'm not advocating that you go
                    around selfishly sucking value out of other people in order for you to get better, I mean that you should go genuinely
                    make friends and add value back to them so it's not all one way, and you can both grow together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, back to the point. I thought that this mentorship group would be something like that, that was how Jack and Pete described
                    it, and that was why I jumped at the opportunity. The bit on the financial assets was actually secondary to me (honestly,
                    even in hindsight!) because I'm not that bothered about retiring in my early 30s. Sure it would be nice, and
                    I have days where I really can't be arsed to go to work, just like everyone else has days like that, but I generally
                    enjoy my job and what I do, and I'd be quite happy to do it for a career. So the financial assets were intriguing, but
                    only played a secondary role in my motivation to join the group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think this partially explains why I didn't see it as a pyramid scheme, I wasn't looking at the financial aspect
                    of it, and therefore my guard wasn't up. I just saw it as an opportunity to join a like-minded group of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How could that ever be a scam?
                </p>
                <h3>The Second Interview</h3>
                <p>
                    At the end of the first call, Jack essentially told me that I'd passed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"Harry, I think you'd be a good candidate to go on to the next stage"</i>, he said. <i>"Let's organise
                    a video call this time with you, me, and Pete. Can you do a week on Saturday?"</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I said that I could, and we agreed to talk then.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I waited the usual two weeks before I spoke to them again, and at the appointed time, I logged onto Zoom and joined the
                    meeting Jack had setup. The first few minutes were filled with the usual small talk, what have I been up to, etc. But
                    pretty soon the second interview began.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this section, I'll introduce the questions and how I interpreted them at the time, I'll also share
                    with you my thoughts on them now, having seen similar discussions about them on the internet. By the way,
                    these questions are absolute red flags to watch out for, they crop up again and again in
                    all sorts of pyramid schemes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Question 1.</b> How familiar was I with marketing methods? Okay this one was interesting, basically if I already knew what a multi-level marketing scheme was,
                    or a pyramid scheme as they're more commonly known, then I'd have likely already known it was a scam, in which case,
                    neither Jack nor Pete would waste their time with me and would quickly end the call. This is why they ask this first. I wasn't thinking
                    anything along those lines at the time, I thought they were trying to get an idea of my business acumen (naive I know).
                </p>
                <p>
                    They
                    specifically asked whether I knew anything about network marketing (another word for pyramid schemes),
                    I said I didn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"That's okay, we'll teach you everything
                    you need to know in the training scheme. It's actually a good thing because if you did know something already,
                    we'd have to get you to unlearn it first because a lot of what common people think and understand about
                        network marketing is wrong."</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That should have been a red flag, they were basically saying, <i>"We're glad you don't know anything
                    about our scam."</i> Being super naive I instead thought <i>"Oh that's a relief then."</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Question 2.</b> What does your 10/10 life look like? This is the first of a set of questions designed
                    to lead you to their desired outcome, getting you to sign up.
                    What's the purpose of this question? At the time I thought it was just a behavioural interview question, designed to see how
                    aspirational I was. What it actually does it get you to describe a desired goal state, ideally one you haven't
                    already attained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I described how I wanted to build businesses to help people and make the world a better place with technology, that is genuinely my life goal,
                    or what I like to think is my life goal, I'm pretty sure I'm still figuring it out. I also mentioned I'd like to live somewhere nice and have enough
                    money not to have to work all the time and spend more time on hobbies.

                    Anyway, they seemed happy with it, and why wouldn't they be, they don't care, they just wanted me to get a solid picture of it
                    in my mind so I'd be more swayed by the later arguments. It's all just psychology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Question 3. </b>Next, they asked me how far along I was towards that goal (out of 10), and whether I was moving towards it or not.
                    Jack told me that his own original answer to that question was a 2.
                    He described how the path he was on at the time wasn't going to take him where he wanted to be.
                    For some reason I said 2 as well, I don't know if I was just saying what they wanted me to hear or not. It's easy to say this in
                    hindsight, but I think in reality I'm more than a two, I'm quite happy with where I am right now and where I'm going, and although
                    I might not end up with that perfect 10/10 life (most people don't and that's okay), I'd do well enough to be happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, despite this, at the time I said what they wanted to hear, and I probably believed it too, maybe I was sucked into the moment
                    of the interview. The question itself is supposed to make you feel stress and urgency by contrasting
                    where your life is now, with where you want to be.
                    If you accept the questions and your answers so far (and you should do because they're your answers), then you're basically admitting
                    that you have this grand ambition that you've just spelled out, but at the moment you haven't achieved it, and aren't on the path to achieving it...

                <p>
                    <b>Question 4. </b>Next they asked me whether I was an independent person, capable of making my own choices and decisions. This one
                    was downright devious. First of all, who wouldn't say yes to that? Everyone wants to be their own person, make
                    their own choices, and make their own mistakes. So naturally, I said yes, and backed it up with an example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jack liked that answer, he said it was important to be an independent thinker, then he said that most people
                    don't understand the value of a mentorship group and that family and friends might try and distract me and talk me
                    out of it, it was important that I wouldn't be a sheep to their advice. Do you
                    see how evil that is? They're preempting your family and friends seeing through the ruse when you tell
                    them about it and warning you that it's a scam. They prime you to think <i>"They don't understand me, I'm
                    independent and will make my own decisions thank you very much."</i> so that the advice falls on deaf ears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Question 5. </b> Jack gave me the following analogy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"Harry, would you be willing to shovel manure every single day for 2 hours a day, for 2 years,
                        without complaining, for a guaranteed payoff of a million pounds at the end?"</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This one is apparently a classic MLM question, so if you want one warning sign to
                    take away from all this to protect yourself, it's to keep an eye out for this question. What they
                    want you to admit to (and what I did actually admit to at the time), is that you are a person who can
                    commit to something for the long term, even if it doesn't pay off for years. Not everybody has the
                    will power to stick something out for two years with no upside, but most people want to
                    believe that they are capable of delaying gratification in order to receive some larger future pay
                    off (and most people are to some extent).
                    What they're trying to gauge here however is how long
                    you'll put up with their pyramid scheme (because there won't ever be a pay off, but the longer you do
                    it, the more money they make).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Question 6. </b>Next, they gave me a commitment test.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"Alright Harry, I've been impressed with your answers and I think my mentors would be happy for you to
                        proceed to the next stage and apply to the training programme. But listen, it turns out that Dom and
                        Karina are coming to London on Wednesday, they don't come to the UK that often and it would be great for your application if you could make it
                        to that meeting and introduce yourself."</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    That was the first time in the whole process that I genuinely felt uneasy, I didn't twig
                    that it was a scam, I just felt lazy, I didn't want the pressure of having to
                    go to London, especially at such short notice and expense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I told Jack this and there was a short pause, then he said: <i>"Sorry to hear that Harry, this was kind of a test to see how
                    committed you really were"</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shit, I've failed, I thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>"But we understand you've got lots going on. I've got some homework that we'd like
                    you to do. Have you heard of the book Business of the 21st Century?"</i> I said I hadn't. <i>"It's a book by a
                    financial guru called Robert Kiyosaki, it's a great read and will give you an introduction to some topics
                    that I'd like to talk about with you next time. We'd like you to read it in three days, by Tuesday if you can, and we'll set up
                    a call for then, how does that sound?"</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There it was. The archetypal symbol of the pyramid scheme, Business of the 21st Century.
                    I'll come back to that later on, but for the moment I'll just say that I felt that same pressure and unease again. Not
                    because I knew what the book was about, or because I'd figured out their scheme, but because I like working at my pace and
                    I didn't want to have to read a book in three days, I had other stuff to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It might have been that laziness that saved me, or perhaps deep down I wasn't as interested in this mentorship
                    group as I thought, but whilst talking on the phone and Zoom had been fine, I was not super thrilled about
                    starting to invest actual time and money into this, despite what I'd just said on the call.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the call finished, I just sat for a while and thought. I eventually decided, for the first time
                    since the whole saga had begun, that I was not interested in pursuing it any further. I'm not just saying
                    this in hindsight, I'm lucky that I genuinely felt this way. I remember going downstairs to talk to my
                    girlfriend about it, I told her all about the call, and what they'd asked, and what they wanted me to do.
                    She thought it all sounded a bit iffy. She's more sensible than I am.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I said to her, <i>"I've already got a good thing going, I've got a
                    good job, my life is on track, I honestly don't fancy spending the next two years of my life working
                    towards this dream life, when in fact I'm not that far off that life already."</i> In the interview, I'd said
                    I was a 2/10 for that life, but I think I was saying that to please them, because the more I thought about
                    it, the more I realised it was a 7 or 8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I remember that at this point, I still genuinely believed that what they were doing was legitimate and that
                    there was an actual pay off after working hard for 2 years, but it didn't sound interesting to me, it all
                    sounded like marketing and sales, and I honestly just didn't think two years of that was worth an
                    early retirement. That's the honest truth. I love what I do at work and if I wasn't working I'd be doing
                    something similar in personal projects, maybe that's why I didn't have that motivation. I can completely
                    understand how someone not in that position would be more tempted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made up my mind then and there that I wouldn't pursue it. I didn't plan to read the book, had
                    no intention of going to London, and planned to let Jack and Pete know the next day.
                </p>

                <h3>Red Flags</h3>
                <p>
                    The next day, I received a text from Jack, it was a link to the PDF version of the book he'd asked me to
                     read. <i>Only</i> because I was curious, I downloaded the book and began to skim the first few pages. It was atrocious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was one of the worst books I'd ever seen, and Robert Kiyosaki is supposedly a good author, I'd read one of
                    his other books, Rich Dad Poor Dad, and I remember my impression of that book was that it was well written
                    and made some good points, but this one...
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you value good books, books that are clearly thought out,
                    with well-considered arguments, that are respectful of the reader, then you'd be pissed off by this book.
                    It wasn't just that it was poorly written and full of retired cliche's, it was appealing to fear,
                    trying to scare the reader into accepting it's arguments.
                    I felt offended by it, and remember, at this point, I still believed that what Jack and Pete
                    were doing was legitimate, even though I'd decided against it. I couldn't believe that
                    this was the big secret that Jack wanted to share with me. I didn't read any more of it, I couldn't,
                    so I googled it instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the first page of results, there were at least three entries with the word "SCAM" in them,
                    I opened one and started to read, and everything clicked. Everything that I had been through was a pyramid scheme,
                    and I'd almost fallen for it.
                    I read more articles and started seeing my story repeated all over the internet, from the random
                    approach by a stranger to the exact list of questions, and of course, the book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I felt angry, at myself and them. I was angry that I hadn't spotted what they were up to sooner, it takes
                    a swipe at your pride when something like this happens. After reading about similar experiences online,
                    I realised I certainly wasn't the only one, many people had not only fallen for the same initial approach but
                    had gone further and even turned up to that first meeting. It turns out that there is <i>always</i> a
                    meeting with the founding mentors that just happens to occur a few days after the second interview. Some people
                    go to that and even start paying the subscription to join the mentorship group. They start attending the training
                    programme, which of course, you have to pay for, and then they are themselves encouraged to start <i>selling</i> to
                    more people and start the process all over again. At this point, the honourable ones understand what happened
                    to them, drop out, and share their experiences with others so they can learn from them.
                    Others clearly continue to propagate the illusion and
                    screw up more lives. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/">Reddit's antiMLM subreddit</a> is full of examples of this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm glad I stopped before then, that's not because I knew better or was more resistant to their tricks, in fact,
                    I fell for all of them. I was just lucky that
                    I was in a position where what they had to offer wasn't attractive enough to me. I can clearly see
                    how easy it would have been to continue, and how easily others can be sucked in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I realised that I now had the upper hand, they didn't know that I knew what they were up to, I thought maybe
                    I could play along, waste their time, take them for a ride just like they had to me. It was definitely tempting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, I just let the whole thing drop, it wasn't worth my while wasting any more time on them.
                    I texted both Pete and Jack and told them I wasn't going to
                    continue. I didn't tell them I'd figured out what they were up to, I just said I had other stuff going
                    on and was too busy to start something new. Jack simply wished me luck, Pete never replied.
                </p>
                <h3>Lessons</h3>
                <p>
                    The most obvious lesson here is that a mentorship group dedicated to helping you build your assets is just
                    another pyramid scheme, but that hardly helps me or others from falling for other more sophisticated tactics in the future. A more general
                    lesson would be not to believe things that are too good to be true, but I knew that already and that didn't stop me from
                    getting sucked in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After reading up quite a bit on MLMs, I want to share <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/57n0wd/avoid_acn_like_the_plague/d8tfrqv/">this reddit list</a> which has a few good tips on what to look for
                    to spot an MLM, although note that they're all buried in the comments. What I hope is most useful though, if you've read this far, is that
                    you now have a new data point in your mental library of experiences, a new pattern to match against, so that if at some point, you are
                    approached in a similar manner, I hope that at least a few alarm bells go off. That's ultimately why I'm sharing this story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The part that is the most confounding, is that the whole pyramid scheme is mixed with this mentorship and
                    self-development philosophy. Proper adherents to the program don't ever talk about how they've managed to
                    scam their <i>downline</i> into effectively paying for their lifestyle, they instead always talk about how
                    the mentorship received has changed them, made them a better person, and how rewarding it's been to develop
                    others in the same way. When the entire scam is cloaked in this way, it's
                    difficult to see what's truly going on.
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/blogs/mentorship/the_mentorship_scam_dom_testimonial.png"/>
                    <p><i>This type of message is repeated over and over. Do such people genuinely believe what
                        they're saying or is it part of the scam? Who knows.</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day, they have no product to sell
                    and no legitimate business model. The only revenue coming into the "business" comes from the pockets of the
                    employees themselves. If those employees are all "retired" and living the lives of their dreams, then
                    5 minutes of a basic economics class will prove to you that it simply cannot work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only way a pyramid scheme can survive, is by roping in more unaware participants, therefore no matter how they may
                    try and dress it up, it should always be possible to spot the fundamental warning signs beneath their lies.
